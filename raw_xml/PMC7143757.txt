Introduction</title><p>Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide and it has re-emerged in several countries in recent years [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 500,000 new cases of brucellosis are reported each year [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and millions of livestock are either infected or at risk [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Incidence is likely significantly underestimated because of the wide distribution, mild clinical features, and frequent misdiagnosis of the disease [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Brucellosis is mainly caused by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp., which are Gram-negative and facultative intracellular &#945;-proteobacteria. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella suis</italic> are the most virulent of these species. Humans are mainly infected by direct contact with infected animals or through the consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products [<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In humans, infection is chronic and patients gradually lose their ability to work. Although rarely fatal, human brucellosis is very serious [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], requiring long-term antibiotic treatment and often causing permanent sequelae [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>At present, animal vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> are live attenuated vaccines, and these have played an important role in controlling the spread of brucellosis [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the efficacy of these vaccines is not ideal [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]&#8212;they can cause abortions and infertility in animals, disease in humans [<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and do not confer sufficient protection [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, S19 and RB51 are two commonly used live attenuated vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> but despite being attenuated, these vaccines can result in infections in humans and are also secreted into the milk of immunized animals [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. RB51 is resistant to rifampicin and penicillin, making clinical treatment challenging. In addition, evaluation of the live attenuated vaccine often requires the use of virulent smooth strains in biosafety level-3 laboratories, which is not conducive to extensive research. However, there are currently no better alternatives [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and, most importantly, there is still no human brucellosis vaccine available [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Efforts toward further attenuation have ultimately failed [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The surface polysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria is an immunodominant antigen, and studies have shown that antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> O-antigen polysaccharide (OPS) elicited by active immunization can provide a protective effect in mice [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, Jacques et al. showed that immunization of mice with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> OPS covalently linked to BSA induces protective effects [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These results demonstrate that antibodies against OPS are associated with anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> effects and may play an important role in host defense [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the development of a brucellosis vaccine based on OPS is a promising avenue for the prevention of brucellosis.</p><p>Polysaccharide conjugate vaccines produced via the covalent conjugation of bacterial surface polysaccharides to proteins have been very successful, with several efficacious vaccines of this type having been produced using chemical methods and approved for market release [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this method involves multiple steps and is time-consuming, making it costly and difficult to apply in developing countries and poorer areas [<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. With the discovery of bacterial glycosylation systems and the development of synthetic biology, the preparation of conjugate vaccines using biosynthetic methods has become a hot topic [<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that an <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-linked glycosyltransferase, PglB, from <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacter jejuni</italic> can be expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and catalyze the glycosylation of its natural substrate, AcrA [<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Subsequently, various vaccines based on the PglB glycosylation system were developed, including vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">Shigella dysenteriae</italic> type I [<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Francisella tularensis</italic> [<xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Several of these vaccines have entered clinical trials [<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Researchers also identified another <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked glycosyltransferase, PglL, from <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis</italic> that has broader substrate specificity and, therefore, transfers a greater variety of polysaccharides for bioconjugate vaccine preparation [<xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. One such example is the transfer of galactose at the reducing end of the OPS of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi A [<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In recent years, a novel PglS (an <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked oligosaccharyltransferase from <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter</italic> spp.) glycosylation system was developed for pneumonia capsule polysaccharide glycosylation [<xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> can be divided into 60 serotypes and six biological types. A highly pathogenic strain is <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> bioserotype 1B/O:8, and <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 is a Class II biosafety hazard organism [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 has an identical structure of repeat units in OPS to that of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> [<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, a bioconjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> could be produced in <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 without biosafety risk. Previously, glycosylated AcrA was obtained in <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 with the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-linked glycosylation system, although this glycoprotein generated an IgG antibody response but failed to exert a protective effect in mice [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we produced a bioconjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> by introducing an <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked glycosylation system into <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9, which avoided the cloning of large fragments of bacterial polysaccharide-encoding genes and the low efficiency of exogenous expression. Besides its biosafety advantages, <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 is easy to manipulate and culture, while <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> grows slowly and requires specific culture conditions. Through the catalysis of PglL, the OPS from <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 could be conjugated to the recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB). A series of animal experiments showed that our bioconjugate vaccine was safe and could induce effective immune responses in mice, providing a potential candidate vaccine for the prevention and control of brucellosis. Moreover, the evaluation of our vaccine made use of the hypovirulent smooth strain of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus,</italic> which is less pathogenic than the virulent smooth strain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-08-00436"><title>2.

To create the conjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> with the <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked glycosylation system, we first needed to verify that the OPS of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> could be recognized by PglL. <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 strain 52212 (YeO9_52212) was used as the host cell because this low-pathogenicity strain has an identical OPS structure to that of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> [<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The pET-pglL-CTB4573H plasmid, from which PglL and rCTB [<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were co-expressed, or the pET-CTB4573H plasmid, from which rCTB alone was expressed, were introduced into YeO9_52212. After induction with IPTG and overnight culture, the total protein was extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining and western blotting showed that the molecular weight (MW) of rCTB when expressed alone was only around 15 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The MW of rCTB increased when PglL was co-expressed, indicating that rCTB might have been glycosylated. Further, two bands for rCTB were observed in YeO9_52212 cells expressing pET-pglL-CTB4573H. The lower band showed a slightly shifted MW compared with CTB4573H and the higher band had a MW between 35&#8211;40 kDa.

The higher MW band of glycosylated CTB4573H (CTB-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>) was detected by both antibodies, while the lower band was not observed because of the poor immunogenicity of short-chain OPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). CTB naturally exists in a pentameric form [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To verify whether glycosylated CTB4573H was also in a polymeric state, we performed native gel electrophoresis.

For traditional live attenuated vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, the virulent smooth strain of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> has to be used to evaluate the protective effects (mainly through measurement of the clearance rate of bacteria in the mouse spleen). In contrast, there is no unified evaluation standard for the bioconjugate type of vaccines, and preliminary evaluation of their protective effect can be evaluated through infection with the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> hypovirulent smooth strain. Fourteen days after the third immunization, mice were challenged with a non-lethal dose (1.03 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse) of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> hypovirulent strain A19 (A19). For all treatment groups, the TNF-&#945; levels began to decline after reaching a peak on the 5th day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Serum TNF-&#945; levels in the PBS-immunized group and the OPS<sub>Ba</sub>- and OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al-immunized groups increased markedly following infection. In contrast, C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al vaccination significantly inhibited the production of TNF-&#945;, and TNF-&#945; levels in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group were lower than those in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al group. We also measured serum IL-1&#946;, IL-2, and IL-6 levels in the immunized mice but no significant differences in expression were detected.</p><p>Seven days following infection, the mice were dissected and their spleens were removed. We found that the spleen size had increased following infection, with a significant increase in the spleen weight in the PBS group compared with the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group, and in the OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00436">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). We enumerated the bacteria in each spleen and observed approximately 10<sup>3</sup>&#8211;10<sup>3.5</sup> CFU of A19 in C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al-vaccinated mice. In contrast, the bacterial loads of other groups remained around 10<sup>4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>4.5</sup> CFU in the spleen, which was significantly higher than those of mice immunized with C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). These results indicated that mice immunized with C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al were effectively protected against invading pathogens and the resulting lethal cytokine storms.</p><p>Spleens and livers were paraffin-sectioned and stained with HE. Compared with the control mice, the immunized mice showed different degrees of pathological changes in their spleens and livers. The spleens of all vaccinated mice with low-spectroscopy observation showed an increase in the white pulp, reflecting the proliferation of lymphocytes. Multinucleated giant cells with varying numbers and shapes of nuclei caused by foreign bodies increased with high-spectroscopy observation (green arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Evaluation of Protection against the Lethal dose Challenge</title><p>After demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the vaccine against non-lethal infection, we next evaluated its protective efficacy against lethal challenge. Separate groups of mice were immunized with PBS, OPS<sub>Ba</sub>, OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al, C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>, or C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al as described previously and challenged with a lethal dose of A19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Mice were challenged i.p. with approximately 3 &#215; LD<sub>50</sub> of A19 (1.54 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse) 2 weeks after the last vaccination, and survival was monitored for up to 14 days. All of the PBS-vaccinated mice died within 2 days and the 2-week survival rates in the OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al groups were no more than 60%. In contrast, vaccination with C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> or C-OPS <sub>Ba</sub>+Al provided 100% protection without the adjuvant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00436-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). These results demonstrated that the administration of C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was far more effective than OPS<sub>Ba</sub> in protecting mice against lethal challenge with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>. These findings were consistent with previous studies.</p><p>To verify the stability of the protective effect of C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> in mice, we immunized another three groups of mice with PBS, C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> or C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>+Al as described above to assess their survival rate following a higher lethal dose challenge (2.51 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse, 5 &#215; LD<sub>50</sub>).

The IgG titers against A19 LPS in the sera of these mice were then measured. There was a significant difference in titer between the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>- and PBS-vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00436">Figure S5A</xref>). Finally, immunized mice were infected with an even higher dose of A19 (lethal to 20% of PBS-vaccinated mice).

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we developed a novel bioconjugate vaccine candidate against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> based on a bacterial <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked glycosylation system. YeO9_52212 was engineered to act as the host organism for the production of the bioconjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>. Because YeO9_52212 is less pathogenic and more easily cultured than <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, we were able to avoid the large-scale culture of highly pathogenic bacteria. Our results demonstrated that C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> induced strong immune responses against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> even in the absence of the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant.</p><p>We chose OPS as the target for vaccine development because of its ability to elicit antibodies that can confer protection against infection [<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The glycoprotein generated in YeO9_52212 was able to induce antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> as a result of the similarity in OPS between these two bacterial species [<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The OPS of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. is a homopolymer of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-formyl-perosamine (4-formamido-4,6-dideoxy D-mannose) with various proportions of &#945;-(1&#8594;2) and &#945;-(1&#8594;3)-linkages and it has three antibody reactivities (A, M, and C). The A epitope corresponds to five or more continuous sugar units with &#945;-(1&#8594;2) linkages and is typical of some <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> biovars. The M epitope corresponds to the pentasaccharide with four &#945;-(1&#8594;2)-linked and one &#945;-(1&#8594;3)-linked polymers of the same sugar and is characteristic of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis.</italic> The C epitope represents the ratio of A/M reactivities highly repeated in the OPS of all biovars [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> contains ~98% of the A epitope, <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> has a unique 1:7 ratio of &#945;-(1&#8594;3)- to &#945;-(1&#8594;2)-linked polymers, and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> has only the M epitope of the pentasaccharide repeating unit [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 generates strong cross-reactivity with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> as its OPS is a homopolymer of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-formyl-perosamine with exclusively &#945;-(1&#8594;2)-linkages [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is thus reasonable to speculate that the bioconjugate vaccine produced in YeO9_52212 would induce cross-reactive immune responses against <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>. Cross-protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> remains to be verified, and this could further expand the scope of vaccine application.</p><p>Although the use of AcrA as a carrier protein failed to exert a protective effect in mice against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> infection in a previous report, the feasibility of the use of carriers proteins as part of the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine preparation strategy was demonstrated [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since carrier proteins play an important role in immune response, protein toxins such as the tetanus toxoid, the recombinant exotoxin A protein from <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (rEPA), the diphtheria toxoid, and rCTB used in the present study, are usually included in the vaccine design for better stimulation of the immune system [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our previous studies found that different carrier proteins have different immune effects, and we demonstrated that the use of rCTB in bioconjugate vaccines conferred superior protection against <italic toggle="yes">Shigella flexneri</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi A than rEPA, another commonly used carrier protein [<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The bioconjugate vaccine in the present study used rCTB and exhibited a potent immune effect that was probably attributable to the good immunoadjuvant properties of CTB itself [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as CTB has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory responses and regulate T-cell immune responses [<xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, the rCTB pentamer can form more complex spatial structures, which facilitates activation of the immune response. We found that protein glycosylation did not change the pentameric structure of the substrate rCTB protein, as shown by the native PAGE results in this study. This finding also suggested that the size, structure, charge, and other physical/chemical properties of carrier proteins should be considered for the rational design of vaccines in the future.</p><p>Because there is no clear and unified evaluation model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines, we used TNF-&#945; as an indicator of the protective effect of the vaccine. TNF-&#945; is one of the most important proinflammatory cytokines, and its secretion is associated with inflammatory responses caused by infection. TNF-&#945; is one of the first cytokines released by macrophages following <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> infection, and its production results from direct interactions between <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and macrophages [<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. TNF-&#945; plays a crucial role in enhancing IL-12 production [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and depletion of IL-12 leads to decreased production of interferon-&#947; and nitric oxide, resulting in exacerbation of infection [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here, the serum TNF-&#945; levels in mice immunized with C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> were significantly lower than those in the other treatment groups after infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>. Infection via the intraperitoneal route can induce a strong inflammatory response. There was a higher level of recall response in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>-vaccinated group because of pre-existing protective antibodies, which could quickly neutralize and kill the invading pathogens, such that the bacterial loads in the spleen were significantly reduced. Because the pathogen could be rapidly cleared, there was no strong immune response; in contrast, the mouse spleens were enlarged in the PBS- and OPS<sub>Ba</sub>-immunized groups, with a significantly increased proportion of white pulp observed.</p><p>The two most common routes of human infection for Brucellosis are the ingestion of contaminated dairy products or inhalation of contaminated aerosols. This leads to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization of organs such as the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. Owing to its potential spread by aerosols, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> has been classified as a biological threat [<xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This poses a risk during the production of live attenuated vaccines, requiring stricter production requirements and resulting in higher production costs. Thus, the live attenuated vaccines could lead to the possibility of leakage contamination. Research and development of new candidate vaccines are urgently required. Our study provides a conceptual advance for vaccine production against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>&#8212;not only is the described production process safer and more economical than that used for traditional live attenuated vaccines, but our strategy also avoids the potential risk of virulence reversion and antibiotic resistance. Our conjugate vaccine could also be used to diagnose brucellosis [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-08-00436" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, subunit vaccines make it easy to distinguish between immunization and natural infection in animals. To further improve safety, in future studies we will delete the virulence-related genes of the YeO9_52212 engineered bacteria to render it even more suitable for industrial production.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Huaiqi Jing and Xin Wang from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for providing strains and discussions.
