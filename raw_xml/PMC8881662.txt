The study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced dose (5.0 &#215; 10 9 cfu) of S19 vaccine in adult cattle and its shedding in the milk of vaccinated cattle using molecular techniques. The OIE recommended tests (RBPT, SAT, and iELISA) for brucellosis screening in cattle were used. Seronegative cattle (n = 90) of different age groups (young, old heifers &amp; milking cows, n = 30 each) were selected for the vaccine trials. Antibody titers were recorded at 7th, 21st, 30th, 60th, 90th and 120th days post-vaccination (DPV) to monitor the immune responses following vaccination and at 150th, 180th, 210th and 240th DPB following booster-dose to an intraocular group. The humoral immune responses observed by RBPT and ELISA, proved that antibody titers persisted in s/c group compared to the i/o group in all categories. The IFN-&#947; stimulation (CMI) due to reduced dose vaccination was noticed early as 30th in all groups and declined after 90th DPV, with higher IFN-&#947; stimulation among the s/c group. The Bcsp31 and IS711 targeted PCR detected the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DNA in milk samples (n = 120) from the vaccinated cows (n = 30) and confirmed by qPCR (TaqMan assay) at 30th, 60th, 90th and 120th DPV. A Significant number, 70% (7/10) was detected in s/c by qPCR. BCSP31 sequence was deposited at NCBI GenBank (accession no. MK881173-6). PCR and qPCR techniques could provide a reliable diagnosis of brucellosis from milk. The intraocular route remains the safer route for vaccinating adult cattle than subcutaneous.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Brucellosis, Cattle, Intraocular, Reduced-dose, Strategy, S19-vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brucellosis</kwd><kwd>Cattle</kwd><kwd>Intraocular</kwd><kwd>Reduced-dose</kwd><kwd>Strategy</kwd><kwd>Strain-19-vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Brucellosis is a complex zoonotic disease with significant epidemiological, economic, and global health impacts, particularly for human and animal populations in developing countries that rely on cooperative farming and agricultural practices [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Brucellosis remains endemic in many regions of the world, including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean basin [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Milking cows demonstrated a better ability to develop antibodies when administered by the s/c route in comparison with young and old heifers. While there was a consistent decrease in response titers in the s/c route of administration as days go until day 120, the response remains the same all through for the i/o route, except day 30. While, by iELISA, the same titer was produced, but beginning from day 30 there was a higher response by s/c administration compared to i/o. Increase in titer by s/c route until day 90 where the peak was achieved before subsiding during day 120.

Among the 3-categories, the percentage of i/o responders ranged between 10-20% at 30th through 90th dpv. However, it was a contrary outcome in the subcutaneously vaccinated groups. Among the old heifers (n = 10), few animals produced IFN-&#947; at 21st, 30th, 60th, and 90th dpv with little higher responses (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>). Similarly, it was an intermittent production of IFN-&#947; that was noticed among the subcutaneously vaccinated young heifers with a relatively lower proportion. However, a higher IFN-&#947; production was noticed among the subcutaneously vaccinated milking cows&#8217; category (n = 10) viz: 2(20%), 3(30%), and 2 (20%) at 30th, 60th, and 90th DPV respectively (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>). Furthermore, an irregular production of IFN-&#947; was noticed among the intraocularly vaccinated milking category at 21st and 60th DPV. Generally, the IFN-&#947; stimulation (CMI) due to reduced-dose vaccination was noticed at later days, 30th dpv (first month) in most groups. It subsided after the 90th dpv (3-months later), except among the old heifers, which started as early as the third week (21st) dpv (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>).

Generally, immunity due to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in vaccinated and infection involves both antibody-based HIR and CMI [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and both were detected in this study. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> Strains-19 and RB51 are live vaccines and therefore can elicit immune response due to intracellular stimulation of macrophages and subsequently that of pro-inflammatory interleukins, cytokines, and other cellular mediators due to phagolysosome fusion [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, strong HIR not accompanied by CMI cannot provide total protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. Vaccine candidates that evoke a profound CMI&#8211;IFN&#8211;&#947; response confer a better level of immunoprotection in vaccinated adult cattle. In this study reduced-dose, S19 provided a better response than other vaccination strategies as earlier reported in American research [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0235">There was significant agreement among the serological screening tests employed in this study, as indicated by the kappa statistic; which is in line with the earlier reports [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, other studies have reported ELISA as an alternate test to both RBPT and SAT for diagnosis of brucellosis in animals with high sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The results in this study are also in line with the recommendations set by the OIE [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], that two tests at a time are recommended in screening for brucellosis for import and export of animals and animals&#8217; products across borders [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0240">Generally, in this study, the proportion of animals responding to the vaccine was less than those that did not respond to the vaccine except for mulching cows. Among young and old heifer categories, the response rate ranged from 10-50% with all types of tests. In comparison, milking cows' administration through S/C resulted in up to 80% of the animals responding, this could be due to age and immunocompetence of the adult cows compared to the heifer's group [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. But this is contrary to the findings of [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] who reported 100% responders in the s/c group and more than 60% in the i/o category. This might be as a result of the different vaccines used in the two studies, in which India Immunological Limited (IIL, India), and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD, France Company) vaccines were used instead of the Hester vaccine, Gujarat, India, used in our study coupled with the breed of animal, geography, and age, as referenced earlier age and breed are palpable risk factors to respond to infection and vaccination in animals. However [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], had reported consistent findings of low responders with no persistent antibodies, following reduced-dose vaccination in adult cattle in Zambia.</p><p id="p0245">The HIR induced by both intraocular reduced-dose of S19 vaccination, found in this study, was promising and protective enough to protect the adult cattle vaccinated intraocularly (above-calfhood) from <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, and for up to 4 months dpv with no booster. Though the immune response was shown to persist in the subcutaneously vaccinated cattle, there is a tendency of interference with the serological screening of brucellosis by increasing the number of positive reactors in a herd. This may probably make it difficult to differentiate vaccinated from naturally infected animals (DIVA), especially if the DIVA test is not available to judge the argument.</p><p id="p0250">The results in this study were consistently similar to the earlier reports [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which also reported that animals vaccinated with a reduced-dose intraocularly were found to be free from detectable antibodies after three months post-vaccination. Implying that, there could be no persistence antibodies with reduced-dose given intraocularly. Similarly, Raghunandan et&#160;al. [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] had reported a consistent negative result from milk samples of vaccinated cattle and buffaloes within 30 dpv by both culture and ELISA techniques. The rapid decrease in the antibody suggested that this practice could be adopted as a new strategy in the national control program against Brucellosis, especially for those cattle that missed their calfhood vaccination, to increase the vaccine coverage as the only means of brucellosis disease control in India, aside from the &#8220;Test and Slaughter&#8221; method. A booster dose was administered to the intraocular group to ensure immunocompetence over a long period [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The same scenario following booster-dose in the intraocularly vaccinated cattle was reported by [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who also reported on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose over the full dose subcutaneous vaccination. A bit higher increase in responders was noticed among vaccinated milking cows compared to that of the two heifers&#8217; category, which was another peculiar finding of this study. Among young and old heifer categories, the response rate ranged from 10-50% with all types of tests. In Comparison, milking cows administration through S/C resulted in up to 80% of the animals responding, for a reason related to the age of the animal. The immune response to most antigens in cattle progresses with the increasing age [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is consistent with the findings of [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], who reported that the HIR of the conjunctival vaccine was comparable with that of subcutaneous standard-dose vaccine after booster dose, indicating the great advantage of a booster dose [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], with fewer complications.</p><p id="p0255">Moreover, the HIR induced by S19 reduced-dose vaccine in this study was also determined by iELISA. During the dpv, iELISA was found a more useful test in detecting antibody titers than RBPT due to its high sensitivity. The kappa statistic results revealed agreement between the tests (RBPT and ELISA, SAT and ELISA and RBPT and SAT) to be 0.87 (95% CI: 0.857&#8211;0.882), 0.70 (95% CI: 0.684&#8211;0.718), and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.809&#8211;0.834) respectively, which indicated strong agreement between serological tests. Subsequently, the strategy of conjunctival S19 reduced-dose vaccination was adopted in the USA by [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to control brucellosis in problem cattle herds under an endemic situation. Similarly [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], reported that the use of the S19 reduced-dose vaccination strategy had been proved widely accepted in Zambian settings to control brucellosis. Nevertheless, OIE also prescribed conjunctival vaccination of bovines with a reduced-dose of the S19 vaccine [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which can be used as a tool for the prevention of brucellosis in animals above-calfhood age under an endemic situation like Hisar, Gaushala.</p><p id="p0260">The CMI-Response by IFN-&#947; Assay was detected in this study. A reasonable amount of IFN-&#947; was produced due to reduced-dose vaccination and the standard concentration of IFN-&#947; titer (0.025&#8211;50.0 ng/ml) was detected among the three groups of vaccinated cattle, an indication of CMI due to intracellular pathogens (live-vaccine). The immunoprotection against brucellosis due to challenged and infection involves both HIR and CMI responses, as earlier confirmed by [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The signaling of the presence of LPS by cellular defense such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and monocytes has evolved over centuries to provide the host with a rapid recognition and response towards infections due to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This quick innate response against LPS involves the release of a range of pro-inflammatory mediators such as Interleukins (IL-6, IL12, IL1&#946;), cytokines (IFN-&#947;), and other cellular mediators in enough quantities to mediate the host substantially by promoting inflammation and priming the immune system to eliminate the invading organism and development of memory immune cells against subsequent attacks. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella's</italic> ability to stimulate IL-12 secretions allows it to drive Th0 cells to differentiate into Th1 effector and memory cells that are the central feature of the potential use of the <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> as a vaccine carrier [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p id="p0265">Lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine detection assays are the most widely used index of CMI responses. A useful method to reveal the presence of CMI response against <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> S19 could be the detection of IFN-&#947; following lymphocyte stimulation with the specific antigen. In principle, the IFN-&#947; test (Bio-Rad, UK) utilizes the &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">in vitro&#8221;</italic> technique, the same mechanism that could be stimulated &#8220;<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>&#8221; by the antigen. According to the previous studies, on the reduced-dose vaccination conducted by [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species can elicit a macrophage response through the production of IFN-&#947; by stimulated T lymphocytes both in the mice model and in cattle infected with <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p id="p0270">The CMI response against the <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> S19 vaccine studied by IFN-&#947; assay revealed a promising intervention in the old heifer's group of cattle and the milking cows inoculated with a reduced-dose vaccine. Generally, the IFN-&#947; stimulation (CMI) due to reduced dose vaccination was noticed lately in all groups, on the 30th (first month). It declined after the 90th-day post-vaccination, except among the old heifers, which started as early as the third week (21st) day post-vaccination. The IFN-&#947; response was noticed around the 30th-day post-vaccination, and comparatively high on 60 DPV in reduced dose intraocularly vaccinated group in comparison with the cattle in the subcutaneous group but also showing a higher serological titer at the same peak of 60th DPV. This finding was an indication of good CMI response, which is the critical indicator in controlling and eliminating intracellular pathogens like <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species. However, a contrary view was reported by [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], who observed the increased level of IFN-&#947; during the first-week post-vaccination. It reduced the level of IFN-&#947; on the second and third week after vaccination with <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> S19 reduced-dose subcutaneously route vaccine. However, from 90th to 120th DPV, the percentage of responders drastically declined in all groups, hence the need for the booster dose after 120th DPV among intraocular groups only, as per the recommendation of [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It appears there are instances of delayed response to the vaccine or levels undetectable with the test employed in all categories and with all test types and this is not unrelated to the fact that the dose has been reduced coupled with the change of the route of administration and the antibodies stimulation due to vaccine could be delayed especially that of IgM and IFN-&#947; by stimulated T lymphocytes. However, the immunoprotection was there and the animals were protected.</p><p id="p0275">Similarly, the intraocularly vaccinated cattle have shown good CMI responses in all categories but with a low proportion of animals compared to subcutaneously vaccinated groups. On the contrary, this finding is relatively lower compared with the most recent study by [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; and previously by [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The discrepancies might be related to the different types of animals&#8217; breed, age group, vaccine dose, and vaccine type used in the studies. Most importantly, the vaccine vials used in those previous studies contain 80 &#215; 10<sup>10</sup> CFU compared to the 40 &#215; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU used in this study, this alone may cause an increase in the immune response to be higher than our findings due to relatively low number of viable organisms. Secondly, the immune response is age and breed-dependent. Comparatively, the subcutaneous group, on the other hand, had higher CMI responses in all the groups. The pattern of immune-response found in this study demonstrated that vaccination of adult animals with a reduced-dose of S19 vaccine by conjunctival route did not induce persistent antibody titers, and the level of protection achieved is comparable to that of the full-dose subcutaneous counterpart. This finding was earlier reported by [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], who confirmed the efficacy and safety of reduced-doses due to good immunoprotection with no persistent antibody titers and no abortion, which are the noteworthy limitations in the case of standard subcutaneous full dose vaccination.</p><p id="p0280">In this study, the vaccination by S/C route with standard dose produced almost 80&#8211;100 % seroconversion. In the low dose conjunctival vaccine group, there was less seroconversion, and even after booster 100% seroconversion was not noticed. This could be attributed to vaccine strain colonization mostly restricted to the lymph nodes of the head in case of conjunctival vaccination [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], whereas, S/C vaccination systemically extends colonization to other lymphoid organs including the spleen; hence a higher serological response.</p><p id="p0285">Detection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> S19 in Milk based on the vaccination route at DPV was also a peculiar finding in this study. It has been speculated that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella organisms</italic> could be secreted intermittently in the milk of infected cattle, depending on the number of infective doses, age, and stage of infection (chronicity of the disease). Most recent reports by [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] confirmed the detection <italic toggle="yes">of Brucella organisms</italic> from the milk of infected cows. In our study, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> S19 DNA was detected and characterized from the milk of vaccinated milking cows using the <italic toggle="yes">bcsp-31</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">IS711</italic> targeted PCR and confirmed by TaqMan probe-based qPCR assay, and this is precisely consistent with the approach of [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The intraocularly vaccinated cows remain safer in terms of shedding of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> organisms in milk as compared to the subcutaneously vaccinated cows. Because DNA of <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> could not be detected by PCR in the intraocular group during DPV except in one cow, in which it was detected in milk (DNA) by both PCR and qPCR at 90th DPV. The reason maybe because of the age and immune status of the animal at the beginning of the experiment. Also, the animal may have become infected from the shedding of subcutaneous counterparts or infected animals at the <italic toggle="yes">Gaushala</italic> due to mixing. Shedding of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species in milk from vaccinated and infected cows has a tremendous public health consequence. It might increase the herd-level prevalence over time due to the shedding of the live bacteria in milk as reported by earlier researches [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p id="p0290">However, among the subcutaneous route, a significant number (&gt;20&#8211;50%), <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DNA was detected in milk at some DPV by PCR. In contrast, a much higher number (60&#8211;70%) of <italic toggle="yes">S19</italic> DNA was detected by qPCR in all the DPV. This might not be unrelated to the high sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR over the conventional PCR in the detection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> nucleic acid in milk and other biological samples [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Hinic et&#160;al. [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported the usefulness of TaqMan real-time PCR as a rapid, easy, and discriminative method as compared to conventional PCR and bacteriological technique for the diagnosis of brucellosis from aborted fetuses and other biological samples. Subsequently, the intraocular booster group was also screened for <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> S19 at specific days post-booster and significant Ct-values at 150<sup>th</sup> and 210<sup>th</sup> DPB, with a higher positivity compared to the initial load during DPV, and this might be due to booster dose. Hinic and others [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] also confirmed the use of molecular methods for the detection and identification of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species from diverse biological samples including milk.</p><p id="p0295">Similarly [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], had reported the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban areas of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in which 10.3 % was detected from the cow milk samples by <italic toggle="yes">IS711</italic>-based real-time PCR. Ning et&#160;al. [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], also identified significant numbers of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DNA from the milk samples positive by MRT and SAT after subjecting them to qPCR and IS711 targeted PCR, respectively. However, a contrary view had been reported by [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that there was not much difference between PCR and bacteriological detection methods. It is concluded that the conventional or real-time PCR will supersede the current diagnostic methods for the detection of <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> in milk. It could be a reliable detection method with acceptability in the nearest future.</p><p id="p0300">Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;melitensis</italic> specific TaqMan probe-based was used to screen for any possibility of <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;melitensis</italic> natural infection among the vaccinated cattle. Nevertheless, no single amplification was detected, an indication of immunoprotection due to S19 reduced-dose vaccination and the absence of <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;melitensis</italic> in the herd. This is consistent with the findings of [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], who also found negative ct-values following S19 vaccination in cattle. Those genes from NCBI with 100% similarity with our isolates were from Maharashtra, India [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0305">The present study concluded that the conjunctival reduced-dose vaccination of adult cattle with S19 vaccine overcomes the problems of persistent antibodies post-vaccination associated with subcutaneous full-dose, which may interfere with herd screening, which is a downside of full dose subcutaneous inoculation of S19 vaccine. The reduced-dose strategy could be used on dairy farms endemic for brucellosis. To control brucellosis on a dairy farm in the shortest possible time, then separation of positive animals coupled with immunization of negative cows is needed. The conjunctival vaccination could also be used on farms that are free from brucellosis so that entry through carrier animals could be avoided otherwise huge losses could occur on entry of brucellosis. If a calf misses calfhood S/C vaccination at the age of 4&#8211;8 months, an alternate way to immunize animals through conjunctival vaccine could be adopted to achieve maximum vaccination coverage against brucellosis in the country.</p><p id="p0310">The immunogenicity provided by the reduced-dose intraocular vaccination was almost similar to that of the subcutaneous counterpart, the s/c administration produced higher titer when compared to i/o administration and there is a possibility of farm contamination due to shedding of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> organisms in s/c. Therefore, the intraocular route was far safer compared to the subcutaneous vaccination.</p><p id="p0315">Sequencing results of the <italic toggle="yes">bcsp31 gene</italic> further confirmed the shedding of the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine in milk following subcutaneous vaccination with <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> S19. Also, the BLAST analysis and Phylogenetic tree showed &gt;99% relatedness with other global isolates from the NCBI GenBank<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> This is the first study of its kind in Hisar, that detected the shedding of the S19 vaccine in milk following subcutaneous and intraocular inoculation and we have contributed to the NCBI database MK881173-6. Therefore, there is a need to enlighten the farmers/public on the risk of shedding <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> organisms in the milk of vaccinated cows and discourage the practices of consumption of raw milk in villages.</p><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>Statement of animal rights</title><p id="p0320">Before our study, a proposal was submitted to the LUVAS Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and was approved vide No. VCC/IAEC/265-93; dated 15/02/2018.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0325">A.
