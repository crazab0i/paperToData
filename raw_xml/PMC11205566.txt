      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is a contagious bacterial disease of livestock caused by facultative intracellular pathogens of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genus <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> includes at least 10 species, with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> primarily infecting sheep and goats and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> primarily affecting cattle. The disease in livestock is characterised by late-term abortions, decreased fertility and reduced milk production [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], resulting in severe economic losses. Brucellosis is also the most common zoonotic disease worldwide [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with the highly contagious <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> considered the major causative agent of human brucellosis [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> has a worldwide distribution, with different species varying in their geographic distribution [<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> currently affects the entire African continent, with its prevalence unknown, and is endemic to North Africa, with a heavy burden on public health, food safety and food security [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>The current live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines administered to animals are effective but unsafe, as they cause abortions in a proportion of pregnant animals and are also pathogenic to humans [<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To secure the livelihoods and health of human populations affected by brucellosis, especially abattoir workers constantly at risk due to close contact with diseased animals, it is imperative that safe and efficacious alternatives to the current live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines be developed.</p>
      <p>Virus-like particles (VLPs) are inherently immunogenic, safe, and DIVA-compliant [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. &#x201C;DIVA&#x201D; is the abbreviation for Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals. VLPs, formed by the assembly of viral structural proteins, exhibit a size and morphology very similar to that of wild-type virions. Proteins presented in their native conformation in repetitive arrays on the surface of VLPs stimulate humoral immunity, whilst the particulate nature of VLPs results in a broad range of T cell immune responses; hence, VLPs have been used as vaccine candidates for a range of human and animal diseases [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. VLPs may also function as molecular scaffolds for the presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Viruses from 14 different families have been used to produce chimeric VLP particles by inserting small antigenic peptides into viral structural proteins [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These include Orbiviruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) and African horse sickness (AHSV), where foreign peptides were inserted into sites within the VP7 core protein and presented to the immune system on either core-like particles (CLPs) [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or soluble VP7 trimers [<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Eliciting a Th1 cellular immune response is considered key in obtaining protection against brucellosis [<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. T cell epitopes have been identified as immunogenic and protective against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> infection in a mouse model [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Protection was mediated through the release of IFN-&#x3B3; cytokines. Four MHC class I epitopes and one MHC class II epitope were thus selected in this study to induce a cellular T cell immune response. The sequences of these epitopes are identical to those in the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> strain and, thus, would most likely also protect sheep and goats from <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection. Vaccine candidate antigens that are conserved between <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> have recently been identified [<xref rid="B20-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Since the high costs of production and a lack of scalability derailed previous attempts to develop insect-cell-produced Orbivirus CLPs as a veterinary vaccine strategy [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], in this study, we aimed to use a well-established transient plant expression system [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The transient expression of heterologous proteins is mediated by either plant viral vectors, <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> bacterium or a combination of the two. The genes that are introduced into the plant cell are transiently expressed because the plant is not stably transformed, with expression only occurring for a few days. However, this short time period is sufficient for large quantities of protein to accumulate, in some cases, to more than 2 g per kilogram of plant material in one week [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The routine transient expression host is <italic toggle="yes">Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, a relative of tobacco that has a fast growth rate, has a defective RNA-silencing system and is amenable to infiltration [<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Transient plant-based production platforms thus offer several advantages over conventional mammalian, avian, insect cell, yeast and prokaryotic expression systems, including high speed, high scalability, eukaryotic post-translational protein modifications and safety due to a lack of contaminating mammalian pathogens [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although glycosylation patterns differ between plant and mammalian proteins [<xref rid="B26-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and despite initial safety concerns about plant-made therapeutics [<xref rid="B27-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], recent Phase I and Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of plant-made virus-like particles (VLPs) in humans [<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A monoclonal antibody [<xref rid="B34-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and a Newcastle disease subunit vaccine for poultry, both plant-produced recombinant proteins, first received regulatory approval in 2006 [<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Elelyso, a mitochondrial enzyme deficiency therapy for Gaucher disease, is the only plant-produced human therapeutic currently licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref rid="B36-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, a recent phase III clinical trial with a plant-produced seasonal influenza quadrivalent VLP-based vaccine (QVLP) has successfully been concluded [<xref rid="B30-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as has a phase II/III clinical trial for a plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 VLP-based vaccine [<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, a large number of plant-produced human and veterinary therapeutics and vaccines have been produced and are in the pipeline for commercialization [<xref rid="B38-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>Techno-economic analyses indicate that the use of whole plants reduces upstream manufacturing costs, while the downstream processing (DSP) costs are almost equivalent to those incurred by bacterial or mammalian-based expression and account for more than 80% of total costs [<xref rid="B23-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reduced cost of plant molecular pharming, in addition to its other benefits, has made this strategy particularly attractive as an accessible and affordable manufacturing platform for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC&#x2019;s) which do not have the infrastructure to implement other more costly expression systems [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although there are currently no large-scale facilities for plant protein production in Africa, we hope that such a platform will be established in South Africa through the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI) initiative [<xref rid="B41-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we sought to insert five different <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> T cell epitopes into a specific insertion site within the top domain of an Orbivirus VP7 protein and assess the ability of these chimeric VP7 proteins to assemble into chimeric-core-like particles (CLPs) when transiently co-expressed with a compatible VP3 protein in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants. The safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of selected plant-expressed chimeric particles was assessed in BALB/c mice, a mouse model of brucellosis.</p>

        <p>Sequences of selected <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> epitopes were inserted into the Orbivirus VP7 following a strategy similar to that described previously [<xref rid="B17-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Gene sequences encoding the native Orbivirus VP3 and VP7 proteins were obtained from the publicly accessible National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. The sequences were codon-optimised for optimal expression in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plant cells and subsequently inserted into the pEAQ transient expression vectors [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] via directional AgeI/XhoI restriction-enzyme-based cloning.

        <title>2.2. Agrobacterium-Mediated Infiltration of N. benthamiana Plants</title>
        <p>The transient expression of the Orbivirus capsid proteins in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT plants was accomplished through <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated infiltration of their leaves. The protocol followed has been described in detail previously [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, expression constructs were transformed into <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> LBA4404 bacterial cells (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) by electroporation and propagated at 28 &#xB0;C. The bacterial suspensions were combined in a 1:1 ratio for CLP assembly. The combinations were subsequently diluted with MMA buffer (10 mM MES hydrate; pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 &#xB5;M 3,5-Dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-acetophenone) such that the final OD<sub>600</sub> was 2. The leaves of four-week-old <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT plants were syringe-infiltrated with the agrobacterial suspensions. The plants were incubated at 27 &#xB0;C for 8 days. <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT seeds were acquired from Icon Genetics GmbH under a material transfer agreement.</p>

        <title>2.3. Protein Extraction and Small-Scale CLP Purification</title>
        <p>Agroinfiltrated <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were harvested 8 days post-infiltration (d.p.i) and extracted and the CLPs purified as previously described [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The plant cell lysate was extracted in 2 volumes of VLP extraction buffer (50 mM bicine, pH = 8.4, 20 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.2% Protease inhibitor cocktail P2714 (Sigma Life Science, Burlington, MA, USA)) in a multipurpose juice extractor (MATSONE, Honolulu, HI, USA) and clarified via low-speed centrifugation (7000&#xD7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>; 20 min; 10 &#xB0;C). Large plant debris was removed via filtration through 2 layers of cheesecloth. Core-like particles (CLPs) were purified using density gradient centrifugation by layering five millilitres of clarified lysate onto 60&#x2013;20% iodixanol (OptiPrep&#x2122; Density Gradient Medium) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) gradients for analysis. Following centrifugation, 500 &#xB5;L fractions were harvested using a Minipuls2 peristaltic pump (Gilson, Madison, WI, USA) and iodixanol fraction 9 subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 staining for 20 min and destaining overnight. The PageRuler<sup>TM</sup> Plus prestained protein ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used as a size marker.

Briefly, the protein bands were in-gel trypsin-digested, resuspended in 2% acetonitrile/0.2% formic acid and analysed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC system coupled to an AB Sciex 6600 Triple TOF mass spectrometer. The obtained MS/MS spectra were compared with the Uniprot Swissprot protein database by using Protein pilot v5, which makes use of the Paragon search engine (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA).

Leaves of <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT plants were infiltrated with recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacteria</italic> combinations, and infiltrated leaves were harvested at 8 d.p.i. Following extraction, the cell extract was clarified via centrifugation (8000&#xD7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>; 10 min; 4 &#xB0;C) and filtered through a Sartoclean GF sterile midicap (3 + 0.8 &#xB5;M) depth filter (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, G&#xF6;ttingen, Germany) and subsequently a 300 K Minimate<sup>TM</sup> Tangential Flow Filtration (TFF) Capsule (Pall Life Sciences, New York, NY, USA) with the pressure not exceeding 2 Bar. Two subsequent wash steps with bicine buffer (20 mM NaCl, 50 mM bicine, pH = 8.4), each resulting in a 1:10 dilution of concentrated lysate, was performed in order to remove the protease inhibitors. The volume of the lysate was reduced to 1/10 of its original volume. The lysates were subsequently filter-sterilized through 0.45 &#xB5;M + 0.2 &#xB5;M Sartopore 2300 Sterile capsules (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, G&#xF6;ttingen, Germany) utilizing a peristaltic pump with the pressure not exceeding 2 Bar. Six-millilitre samples were analysed for protein content by density gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide electrophoresis, as previously described, and putative CLPs were visualised via TEM. The protein content in specific fractions was quantified using a Micro BCA&#x2122; Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The bulk of the protein in 35&#x2013;25% iodixanol fractions consisted of the VP3 and VP7 proteins; however, there were some contaminating plant proteins, so the CLP quantity was slightly less than the quantities calculated. Based on the CLP quantities determined in the iodixanol fractions, we proceeded to infer the quantity of CLPs in the partially purified cell lysate.</p>
        <p>The filter-sterilized samples were used to formulate the primary and boost inoculums for the mice in the safety and efficacy trials. These inoculums consisted of 0.4 &#x3BC;, 0.8 &#x3BC;g or 2 &#x3BC;g antigen and 60% Montanide ISA 61 VG adjuvant in a total volume of 100 &#x3BC;L per mouse. Negative control samples were also prepared and consisted of sterile bicine buffer with 60% Montanide ISA 61 VG adjuvant in a total volume of 100 &#x3BC;L per mouse. The sterile samples were stored at 4 &#xB0;C until use.</p>

        <title>2.7. Efficacy Trials in Mice</title>
        <p>The safety and protective efficacy of the plant-produced chimeric CLP antigens were investigated in BALB/c Mus musculus mice, a small animal model for brucellosis. Mice were bred and maintained in the small-animal facilities at the Preclinical Drug Development platform (PCDDP) unit at North-West University, Potchefstroom. All the regulatory animal ethics approvals for this study were obtained from both the CSIR and NWU animal ethics committees, and approval for the study was obtained from the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural development (DALRRD). The safety of the plant-expressed chimeric CLP antigens was investigated in fifty-five 6&#x2013;8-week-old female BALB/c mice. The safety of the chimeric CLPs at 0.4 &#x3BC;g, 0.8 &#x3BC;g or 2 &#x3BC;g doses per animal was tested in this study, and the safety trial was conducted in three phases due to the limited numbers of animals available at any one time and for the samples to be processed efficiently. The groups, number of animals/group (n), route of administration, inoculation schedule and quantity of antigen inoculated into the animals were established from the literature [<xref rid="B44-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These details for the safety trial are given in <xref rid="app1-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="app">Supplementary Tables S1&#x2013;S3</xref>. The mean weight of the animals prior to euthanasia was 23 g (20&#x2013;28 g) (mean; range). The standard dose of the Rev1 vaccination for lambs and kids between 3 and 6 months of age is between 0.5 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 2 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> viable organisms [<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We reduced the lowest dose by 5 logs for inoculation into mice (5 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> viable organisms). The adjuvant selected as suitable for inoculation was Montanide ISA61VG (Seppic Speciality Ingredients Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India), an aqueous polymeric adjuvant for veterinary vaccines for use in livestock. It has a safety profile equivalent to aluminium salts. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally on Day 1 and then boosted on Day 15. The mice were inspected visually 1 day post-inoculation, and thereafter, once a day to ascertain whether there were any adverse side effects caused by the inoculations, according to PCDDP SOPs. All mice, including those inoculated with the live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine, were kept within the Biosafety Level 3 facility at the PCDDP unit during the course of this study. Mice were euthanized as per the approved protocol (cervical dislocation) on day 45. Spleens were harvested from the animals, and they underwent gross examination by the resident veterinarian. The spleens were weighed and pooled prior to processing for preliminary cellular immune response assays.</p>
        <p>The protective efficacy of the plant-expressed chimeric CLP antigens against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> infection was investigated in fifty-five 9-week-old female BALB/c Mus musculus mice. The use of slightly older mice is advantageous, as the age at which animal models are commonly used is 8&#x2013;12 week to allow for immune system development [<xref rid="B48-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The groups, number of animals/group (n), route of administration, inoculation schedule, quantity of antigen inoculated and challenge details were obtained from the literature and are listed in <xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The mean weight of the animals prior to euthanasia was 24 g (19&#x2013;27 g) (mean; range). The test-group mice were inoculated with either 2 &#x3BC;g chimeric P3 CLP antigen, 2 &#x3BC;g P2 CLP antigen or 2 &#x3BC;g of a combination of P2, P3 and P4 CLPs (0.6 &#x3BC;g of each CLP), with Montanide ISA61VG adjuvant. The positive-control-group mice were inoculated with the commercially available Rev1 brucellosis vaccine (Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP)) with the titre indicated in <xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, while the negative-control-group mice were inoculated with bicine buffer with Montanide ISA61VG adjuvant. One group of mice remained untouched. The mice were inspected visually 1 day pre-inoculation, and thereafter, once a day to ascertain whether there are any adverse side effects caused by the inoculations, according to PCDDP SOPs. The mice in the test groups, as well as those in the negative and positive control groups, were boosted with their respective antigens on day 15. On day 45, all 5 untouched mice, as well as half (5) of the mice from each of the remaining groups, were euthanized via cervical dislocation and their spleens harvested, weighed and pooled for cellular immune response assays. The remaining 5 mice from each group were challenged with the virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> field strain (5 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup>) on day 45 of the trial. The dose of the challenge strain was as per the literature, and it was not expected that the infected BALB/c mice would display overt disease symptoms [<xref rid="B49-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The mice were inspected twice a day for the detection of any symptoms and, in the event that the challenged mice displayed clinical symptoms of disease and/or the mice were deemed to be in pain and distress, as determined by the resident veterinarian (NWU SOP_Viv_Anim 27: Determining pain and distress in laboratory rodents), the protocol dictated that the mice would be euthanized according to NWU SOP_Viv_Anim 1: Euthanasia of rodents. No mice displayed signs of distress or pain during the course of this study and no animals were prematurely euthanized and excluded. The virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> strain was a field isolate obtained from the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, Western Cape Government, which cultured and titrated the strain for use in the challenge experiment. It was transported to the NWU BSL-3 facility with a DALRRD red cross permit. Thirty days after challenge (Day 75), as per the protocol, the mice were euthanised via cervical dislocation and their spleens harvested for spleen bacterial cell count assays. All mice, including those inoculated with the live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine and the virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> field strain, were kept within the Biosafety Level 3 facility at the PCDDP unit during the course of this study.</p>
        <p>All animal experiments complied with the ARRIVE guidelines and were carried out in accordance with the existing and relevant national legislation and codes of practice for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
        <p>Animals in each trial were randomly allocated to different cages and experimental groups. Briefly, a randomisation sequence was obtained using the Experimental Unit Randomizer software programme v1 (2004, Mr Bertus Van Zyl). Following the input of the number of experimental units (Mice), number of experiments (cages), number of experimental units per experiment (mice/cage) and number of groups per experiment (treatment groups/cage), the programme generated a randomization data sheet which indicated how to allocate mice at random to the different cages and treatment groups. The programme allocated a mouse to a different cage and treatment group simultaneously. Mice were thus randomly allocated to different cages, with each mouse in a single cage allocated randomly to a different treatment group. The mice were placed together in a large container, and the first mouse that was removed from the container was allocated to a cage and treatment according to number 1 on the randomisation data sheet. The treatment group was indicated by an ear notch in the right ear of the mouse and the cage number was indicated by an ear notch in the left ear of the mouse. This procedure was also followed until all the mice had been allocated to cages according to the numbers on the randomization data sheet.</p>
        <p>During this study a technician (KV) was solely responsible for the antigen administration to the animals and was aware of group allocation; the researcher (DAR) performing the assays was also not blinded to group allocation and was responsible for conducting the spleen bacterial counts and performing the flow cytometry experiment. The spleen count data were analysed by another investigator (ES), while the flow cytometry data were analysed by an independent investigator (LdP). All investigators were aware of group allocation.</p>

Nine parts of sterile buffer (1 &#xD7; PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) was added per gram of spleen and homogenised by squeezing the organ inside the bag by hand. After homogenisation, serial dilutions of the spleen homogenates were performed (10<sup>2</sup>&#x2013;10<sup>5</sup> dilutions) with 1xPBS. An amount of 100 &#x3BC;L of each dilution was then dispensed in each agar plate (Tryptone Soya Agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)), and the samples were spread with a sterile Drigalski spatula until the inoculum was fully dispersed. Two agar plates were used per sample. The plates were incubated at 37&#xB0; and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 h. The bacterial colonies were counted on each of the plates and the spleen bacterial loads calculated by multiplying the cfus by the corresponding dilution and by 10.

        <p>In order to facilitate the assembly of the chimeric Orbivirus core-like particles (CLPs) in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT plant cells, sequences encoding the structural capsid protein VP7, with or without <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> epitope inserts (P1&#x2013;P5), as well as the VP3 protein, were codon-optimised for <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> expression and cloned individually into the pEAQ-HT plant expression vector [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Leaves of 4-week-old <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> dXT/FT plants were infiltrated with a combination of the recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> bacteria in a ratio of 1:1 (VP7:VP3). Infiltrated leaves were harvested 8 days post-infiltration, as previously reported for optimal Orbiviral capsid protein transient expression [<xref rid="B51-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and the leaf tissue extract was centrifuged through iodixanol density gradients. The presence of the VP7 and VP3 capsid proteins within the iodixanol fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The protein bands corresponding in size to the VP3 (103.2 KDa) and chimeric/WT VP7 (approximately 37.8 KDa) capsid proteins (P1-VP7, P2-VP7 and P3-VP7) were visualised in iodixanol fraction 9 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, lanes 2&#x2013;5). The protein bands corresponding in size to the VP3 (103.2 KDa) and chimeric VP7 (approximately 37.8 KDa) capsid proteins P4-VP7 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 2&#x2013;5) and P5-VP7 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 6&#x2013;9) were visualised in iodixanol fractions 7&#x2013;10. The candidate P1-VP7, P2-VP7 and P3-VP7 protein bands were subjected to LC-MS/MS-based peptide sequencing analysis, and the percentage coverage values with 95% confidence of the VP7 protein were 42.7%, 36.6% and 58.4%, respectively (MS data available on request). The presence of both capsid proteins within the same gradient fractions following centrifugation indicates that these proteins assembled into high-molecular-weight particulate structures. To view these particulate structures, a sample of the 35% iodixanol gradient fraction was stained with uranyl acetate and viewed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particulate structures observed (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a&#x2013;f) resembled core-like particles (CLPs), as previously described [<xref rid="B52-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>These CLPs were approximately 60 nm in diameter with a &#x2018;spiky&#x2019;, knob-like surface.</p>
        <p>Due to the low yield of the P1 CLP (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, lane 3) and P5 CLP (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 6&#x2013;9) proteins observed on the SDS-PAGE gels, it was decided to continue the remainder of this study with the P2 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, lane 4), P3 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a, lane 5) and P4 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 2&#x2013;5) CLPs. Protein quantification of selected iodixanol fractions with the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) indicated that the P2, P3 and P4 CLP protein yields ranged from 0.086 to 0.155 mg per gram of fresh leaf weight.

        <p>The safety trial was performed with 0.4 &#x3BC;g, 0.8 &#x3BC;g and 2 &#x3BC;g antigen doses of the P2, P3 and P4 CLP antigens. The CLPs were partially purified by a combination of depth filtration and tangential flow filtration and subsequently quantified. The trial was performed in three phases due to the limited numbers of animals available at any one time and limited capability to process large numbers of samples. Each phase tested different concentrations of antigen, and positive and negative control groups were included in each phase. In the first phase of the trial, the test-group mice were inoculated with either 0.4 &#x3BC;g P2 CLP antigen or 0.4 &#x3BC;g wild-type CLP antigen (<xref rid="app1-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). The wild-type CLP antigen was included to determine whether the inserted <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> epitope causes any adverse side effects. During the second phase of the trial, 0.4 &#x3BC;g and 2 &#x3BC;g antigen doses of each of the P3 and P4 CLPs were tested for their safety in mice (<xref rid="app1-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). During the third phase of the safety trial, 0.8 &#x3BC;g antigen doses of the P2, P3 and P4 CLPs were tested (<xref rid="app1-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="app">Table S3</xref>). On day 45 of each phase, the mice were euthanized. No adverse effects were observed in any of the fifty-five mice during the three phases of the safety trial, and we concluded that 0.4 &#x3BC;g, 0.8 &#x3BC;g and 2 &#x3BC;g antigen dosages of plant-expressed chimeric P3 and P4 CLPs were safe in the mouse model of brucellosis. Due to its safety at the 0.4 &#x3BC;g and 0.8 &#x3BC;g antigen doses in mice, the 2 &#x3BC;g antigen dosage of the chimeric P2 CLP was also presumed to be safe in the mouse model.</p>

        <title>3.3. Protective Efficacy of Plant-Expressed Orbivirus CLPs in BALB/c Mice</title>
        <p>Next, we conducted a protective efficacy trial in fifty-five additional BALB/c mice. As we planned to challenge with a virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> isolate, we decided on an antigen dose of 2 &#x3BC;g CLP antigen/mouse. P2 and P3 CLPs were tested individually for their ability to protect mice against virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> challenge (2 &#x3BC;g/mouse), and the P2, P3 and P4 CLPs were also combined to assess whether greater protection may be elicited with a combination of CLPs (0.6 &#x3BC;g of each CLP). The CLPs were administered with Montanide ISA61VG adjuvant. The groups, number of animals per group, route of administration, inoculation schedule and quantity of antigen inoculated are listed in <xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The positive-control-group mice were inoculated with the commercially available Rev1 brucellosis vaccine (OBP), while the negative-control-group mice were inoculated with bicine buffer administered with Montanide ISA61VG adjuvant. One group of mice remained untouched. The mice in the test groups, as well as those in the negative and positive control groups, were boosted with their respective antigens on day 15. On day 45, all five untouched mice, as well as half (five) of the mice from each of the remaining groups, were euthanized and their spleens harvested for cellular immune response assays. The spleens from the mice of each group were weighed and pooled for further analysis. The remaining five mice from each group were challenged with a virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> field strain on day 45 of the trial. Thirty days after the challenge, as per the protocol, the mice were euthanised and their spleens harvested for spleen bacterial cell counts. Mice from both the test and control groups displayed no adverse effects during the duration of the trial, even after the challenge with the virulent Brucella strain. This result was expected from the literature, as BALB/c mice do not display symptoms of Brucella infection [<xref rid="B49-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

        <title>3.4. Measurement of Cellular Immune Response by Flow Cytometry and Cytokine Secretion Assay</title>
        <p>Experiments performed to determine whether a cellular immune response was elicited in the mice included flow cytometry to determine the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the antigen-stimulated splenocytes and an interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x263;) cytokine secretion assay, where the secretion of IFN-&#x263; from antigen-stimulated splenocytes was measured using fluorescently labelled antibodies (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The flow cytometry plots obtained clearly indicate an increase in the numbers of CD4+ cells (visible in the lower right-hand quadrant) in groups 5 and 6, that is, in animals inoculated with the P2, P3 and P4 CLP combination and P2 CLPs, respectively (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D,E), when compared to the numbers of CD4+ cells in the untouched (Group 1) and Rev-1 vaccinated (Group 3) animals (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A,B). The CD8+ cells (in the upper left-hand quadrant), however, decreased in groups 5 and 6. This was unexpected, as the P2 epitope is an MHC class I epitope and was intended to elicit a CD8+ cellular immune response. Group 4 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C) had a very slight increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations when compared to Groups 1 and 3. It had been expected that the P3 epitope, being an MHC class II epitope, would elicit an increased CD4+ immune response in the mice in Group 4. Due to a lack of increase of CD4+ cells in Group 4, the increased CD4+ immune response in groups 5 and 6 was elicited not by the CLP particles themselves, but by the P2 epitope that is being presented. Interestingly, even though the P2 CLP dose in Group 5 was 1/3 of the P2 CLP dose in Group 6, the CD4+ immune response elicited was equivalent, indicating that even at lower doses (0.6 &#x3BC;g/mouse), P2 CLPs can elicit an equivalent immune response due to their potent immunogenicity.</p>
        <p>We also assessed whether the CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x263;), a marker of the cellular immune response and an indication of protection against brucellosis (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>From the CD8+ versus IFN-&#x263; plots obtained from the flow cytometry analysis, it is clear that there is a cell population in the lower right quadrant in groups 5 and 6 that expresses IFN-&#x263; in greater quantities (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D,E) than that observed in groups 1, 3 and 4 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x2013;C, respectively). This cell population is, however, clearly not composed of CD8+ cells. From the CD4+ versus IFN-&#x263; plots, it also becomes apparent that a cell population observed in the lower right-hand quadrant in groups in Groups 5 and 6 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D,E), respectively) expresses higher IFN-&#x263; levels than those observed in Groups 1, 3 and 4 (<xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A&#x2013;C, respectively). This cell population is, however, not a CD4+ population. This cell population in Groups 5 and 6 may be one of a few other cell populations known to produce IFN-&#x263;. </p>
        <p>It must be noted at this point that the low numbers of CD4+ cells and the low levels of IFN-&#x263; observed in Group 3 may be due to the experimental design and the specific peptides that were used for splenocyte stimulation. </p>

        <title>3.5. Bacterial Spleen Count Assay</title>
        <p>On day 75 of the trial, spleens were harvested from the mice challenged with the virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> field isolate and homogenised to enable spleen bacterial count assays. A bar graph depicting the average numbers of bacteria (colony-forming units (cfu&#x2019;s)) in the 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup> dilution of the spleen homogenates of each group is depicted in <xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. The average spleen bacterial loads in groups 2&#x2013;6 are listed in <xref rid="microorganisms-12-01047-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
        <p>The animals in positive control Group 3 and test Group 6 inoculated with the Rev1 vaccine and P2 CLPs, respectively, yielded the same number of average colony-forming units (cfus)/spleen. Although low average cfu numbers were expected in the animals inoculated with the commercial Rev1 vaccine, the low cfu number observed in Group 6 indicates that the mice inoculated with P2 CLPS were also protected against the virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strain to the same degree as the Rev1-vaccinated animals. The lowest average cfus/spleen was observed in Group 5, where the animals were inoculated with a combination of P2/P3/P4 CLPs. Although the value of 0.625 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> average cfus/spleen of Group 5 was not much lower than that of groups 3 and 6 (0.7 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cfus/spleen), what is notable is that an equivalent amount of protection is observed in Group 5 and was induced by a third of the dose of each CLP (0.6 &#x3BC;g). The protection observed in Group 5 is most likely due to the presence of P2 CLPs. It is unlikely that P3 CLPs contributed to the protection observed in Group 5, and previous results indicate that P4 CLPs are also unlikely to contribute to the protection observed due to preliminary data obtained. Group 4 had the highest average cfus/spleen and the highest standard deviation. This is because although animals in this group exhibited differing levels of protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, one animal (#4.9) had 8.9 times more than the average of the number of colonies in the other Group 4 animals.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we sought to develop a plant-produced subunit vaccine against brucellosis, which is a contagious bacterial disease of livestock with a worldwide distribution and the most common zoonotic disease. This subunit vaccine would serve as a safe and effective alternative to the current live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines, which are unsafe in animals and pathogenic towards humans [<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The current vaccines are also not DIVA-compliant, and do not allow for the differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals.</p>
      <p>As <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> is an intracellular bacterial pathogen, the enhancement of the Th1 cellular immune response in vaccinated individuals is considered key in obtaining protection against the disease [<xref rid="B18-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B53-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A previous study identified MHC-I- and MHC-II-restricted epitopes that are immunogenic and provide protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> infection in a mouse model [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Protection is mediated through the release of IFN-&#x3B3; cytokine. The sequences of these epitopes are identical to those in the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> strain and thus would most likely also protect sheep and goats from <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. In a recent study, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens and polyepitopes were absorbed onto calcium phosphate nanoparticles and found to induce cross-protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> in mice [<xref rid="B54-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Here, we proposed the presentation of epitopes on the surface of Orbivirus core-like particles (CLPs), previously employed as a particulate presentation system to induce an immune response [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B55-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. CLPs are formed by the assembly of viral structural proteins VP3 and VP7 in repetitive arrays and can stimulate humoral immunity, whilst the particulate nature of CLPs results in a broad range of T cell immune responses. These protein-based CLPs also do not contain genomic material, which makes them safe as well as DIVA-compliant. Several positions within the top domain of Orbivirus VP7 have been identified as being good candidates for the insertion and presentation of foreign epitopes [<xref rid="B15-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B55-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Following the investigation of possible insertion sites using protein modelling, our collaborator Dr Elien Vandermarliere (University of Gent, Belgium) identified an insertion site within the top domain of an Orbivirus VP7 for the individual insertion and presentation of four <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> MHC class I epitopes and one MHC class II epitope [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on the surface of CLPs. </p>
      <p>We subsequently co-expressed the Orbivirus VP3 and chimeric VP7 genes in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants using the pEAQ transient plant expression system [<xref rid="B22-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and assessed CLP assembly. Novel vaccines and antibodies against animal diseases produced in plants have the advantageous of being safe, efficacious and easily scalable and requiring a relatively low capital investment [<xref rid="B58-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which makes plant biopharming an affordable and accessible manufacturing option for the developing world [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
      <p>We successfully assembled all five chimeric CLPs in <italic toggle="yes">N. benthamiana</italic> plants; however, they differed in terms of yield. As very few P1 and P5 CLP proteins were visible on the SDS-PAGE gels, we proceeded to determine the yield of the P2, P3 and P4 CLPs, which ranged from 0.086 to 0.155 mg per g of fresh leaf weight, and used them for safety and efficacy trials in mice. For these trials, the CLPs were partially purified from the plant cell lysate by a combination of depth filtration and tangential flow filtration and then quantified by centrifuging a sample of the final inoculum through an iodixanol density gradient. The filtration methods used here are scalable and thus suitable for commercial manufacturing on an industrial scale. </p>
      <p>BALB/c mice have previously been used as a small animal model for brucellosis [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B59-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Although infected mice do not display overt disease symptoms [<xref rid="B49-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], they do elicit a protective immune response against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> that lowers the number of pathogenic bacteria in their spleens. We first investigated the safety of the plant-produced chimeric CLPs in BALB/c mice. We decided on minimum CLP dose of 0.4 &#x3BC;g for this study. We also investigated 0.8 &#x3BC;g and 2 &#x3BC;g antigen doses of the chimeric CLP antigens. Wild-type CLPs were added as a control to determine whether the epitope sequences may cause adverse side effects. No adverse effects were noted in any of the mice during the three phases of the safety trial, and we concluded that the 0.4 &#x3BC;g, 0.8 &#x3BC;g and 2 &#x3BC;g dosages of plant-expressed chimeric P3 and P4 CLPs; 0.4 &#x3BC;g and 0.8 &#x3BC;g of the P2 CLPs; and 0.4 &#x3BC;g of the wild-type CLPs are safe for use in mice. Although the CLP inoculum also contained contaminating plant proteins, the safety of these plant proteins was also confirmed in this study. Indeed, these plant proteins may have an adjuvant effect resulting in an enhanced immune response against the target antigen [<xref rid="B61-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and remain to be investigated.</p>
      <p>We proceeded with an efficacy trial to investigate whether the individual CLPs, and/or a combination of the three chimeric CLPs, could induce a protective cellular immune response against virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> challenge. As we planned to challenge with a virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> field isolate, we decided on an antigen dose of 2 &#x3BC;g CLP antigen/mouse, previously confirmed as safe in our safety trial. On day 45 of the efficacy trial, the spleens of half the number of the inoculated mice were harvested and processed for cellular immune response assays. The remaining mice were challenged with the virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> field isolate. Flow cytometry was used to determine the numbers of antigen-activated CD4+ and CD8+ cells from the processed spleens from each group as well as the identification of cells secreting IFN-&#x263;, which is a key cytokine for providing protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection [<xref rid="B62-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The mice in Groups 5 and 6, inoculated with a combination of P2, P3 and P4 CLPs and P2 CLPs, respectively, exhibited higher CD4+ T cell levels compared to the remaining groups. As the P3 CLPs (Group 4) and P4 CLPs (preliminary data)) did not elicit this level of CD4+ immune response, it was concluded that the P2 epitope presented on the surface of the CLPs was responsible for eliciting the CD4+ response in groups 5 and 6. The presented P2 epitope was also able to elicit an equivalent CD4+ immune response when inoculated into mice at a lower dose of 0.6 &#x3BC;g in combination with the other CLPs (Group 5). This result was surprising, as the P2 epitope was identified as an MCH class I epitope [<xref rid="B19-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and was expected to elicit a CD8+ cellular immune response. We also determined that a small population of cells secreting IFN-gamma in groups 5 and 6 may be either &#x3B3;&#x3B4; T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells (NKT), B cells or professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [<xref rid="B64-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>
      <p>The average bacterial load in the spleens of the mice in Group 6, inoculated with the P2 CLPs, was equivalent to that of the average load in the spleens of the mice in Group 3 inoculated with the Rev 1 live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> vaccine. This indicated that there was the same level of protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in mice of both groups. It was expected that the Rev 1 vaccine would elicit a greater degree of protection, and thus a much lower bacterial load, in the spleens of Groups 3. This is due to the entire pathogen being able to elicit a broader range of protective responses than a single immunogenic epitope. However, it has been reported that various Rev 1 vaccines being produced around the world have differing residual virulence and immunogenicity [<xref rid="B65-microorganisms-12-01047" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the low protective immunogenicity being exhibited by the Rev 1 vaccine in this study may be due to the specific seed lot being propagated by the manufacturer. </p>
      <p>Interestingly, the average bacterial load in the spleens of the mice inoculated with a combination of P2, P3 and P4 CLPs (Group 5) was almost equivalent to that of Group 6, indicating that even at a third of the antigen dose (0.6 &#x3BC;g), the chimeric CLPs elicit an equivalent level of protection. The protection observed in Group 5, like in Group 6, is most likely due to the presence of P2 CLPs. The high average bacterial load observed in Group 4 in the animals inoculated with the P3 CLPs indicates that the P3 CLPs do not afford notable protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection and are unlikely to contribute to the protection observed in Group 5. The P4 CLPs are also unlikely to contribute to the protection observed in Group 5 due to preliminary data. </p>
      <p>It is of interest to note that although the increased levels of CD4+ cells and IFN-gamma cytokine in Groups 5 and 6 correlate with reduced spleen bacterial loads, these increased levels were not detected in the animals in Group 3, which were vaccinated with the Rev 1 vaccine. However, the animals in Group 3 were also protected against virulent bacterial challenge. The lack of detection of increased levels of CD4+ cells and IFN-gamma cytokine in Group 3 is likely due to the P2, P3 and P4 peptides not being presented by the Rev1 bacterium to the immune system and the harvested splenocytes thus not being stimulated when exposed to these peptides <italic toggle="yes">in vitro.</italic> This does not mean that a protective cellular immune response was not elicited in Group 3, just that perhaps the splenocytes were not stimulated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> by the specific P2, P3 and P4 peptides.</p>
      <p>In this study, we successfully identified one <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> epitope out of a panel of 5 protective epitope candidates that is able to elicit a protective cellular immune response in a mouse model of brucellosis. It is, however, unlikely that the protection afforded by a single epitope will afford the long-lasting protection that is required from a brucellosis vaccine. We are currently in the process of identifying additional protective <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> epitopes that could be combined with the P2 epitope to develop a plant-produced, multi-epitope CLP-based subunit vaccine to provide robust, efficacious and long-lasting immunity against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-microorganisms-12-01047">
      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have successfully demonstrated that the presentation of a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> T cell epitope on the surface of Orbivirus CLPs is able to elicit a protective cellular immune response in a mouse model of brucellosis. A CLP-based vaccine that affords complete protection against virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> isolates has advantages over the current Rev 1 live-attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine, including safety and DIVA compliance. To develop a long-lasting protective vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, we propose a multi-CLP combination vaccine containing different protective epitopes, which will subsequently be tested for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in the target animals, sheep. If successful, this will be the first plant-produced particulate subunit vaccine against brucellosis, a safe, efficacious, and DIVA-compliant alternative to the live-attenuated vaccines currently on the market.</p>
