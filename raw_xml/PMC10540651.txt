        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>The zoonotic bacteria, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella canis</italic>, is becoming the leading cause of canine brucellosis in Europe. In dogs, it causes reproductive problems as well as non-specific lameness or discospondilitis. In humans, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> can be origin of chronic debilitating conditions characteristic to its genus such as undulant fever, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Although <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> shows some pathogenic characteristics similar to <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, it lacks surface O-polysaccharide, like nonzoonotic <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic>. This review shows that host&#x2013;<italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> interactions are still poorly understood, with many knowledge and capability gaps, causing relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of existing diagnostic tools. Currently, there is no vaccine for this rough <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species. Besides, antimicrobial therapy does not guarantee bacterial elimination, and infection relapses are frequently reported, increasing the risks of antibiotic resistance development. <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has been detected in dogs in almost all European countries which increased human exposure, but currently there is no systematic surveillance. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis is not included in Animal Health Law, and therefore there is no legal framework to tackle this emerging infectious disease. To map out the diagnostic strategies, identify risks for human infections and propose management scheme for infected pet and kennel dogs, we present current understanding of canine <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis, outline major knowledge gaps and propose future steps. To address and highlight challenges veterinary and public health services encounter in Europe, we developed two <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection scenarios: of a single household pet and of a kennel dog in larger group.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pet animals currently occupy an important position in our society. In the European Union, the number of dogs is estimated to be 61 million [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and the dog population is constantly increasing. Around the World, canine brucellosis has been mainly caused by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella canis</italic>, while in Europe, until 2000s dog infections were caused occasionally by <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>. Until then <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> was only identified after being diagnosed as causative agent in imported dogs. <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is an important cause of infertility in dogs and has been recognized as the cause of significant economic losses in kennels with infected dogs. Canine brucellosis, due to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, is characterized by one or more of the following clinical signs: miscarriage or absorption in the pregnancy, orchitis, epididymitis, endocarditis, uveitis, and discospondylitis. In humans, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> can cause undulant fever, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, etc., and if untreated endocarditis and disease of central nervous system. Therefore, canine brucellosis due to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> as a public health threat should be considered within the context of the relationship between dogs and humans, especially when close contact with children or immunocompromised people is present [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and as an occupational hazard for breeding kennel personnel, veterinarians and veterinary nurses, as well as dog owners.</p>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> can infect, survive, and replicate in various host cells, with the higher affinity to the cells of the reproductive and immune systems [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For intracellular infection, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> have evolved multiple strategies to evade immune response by modulating innate and the adaptive immune systems, as well as autophagy and apoptosis mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As it has rough lipopolysaccharide, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has variable success entering macrophages or monocytes, while thorough preserved PI3-kinase is much more successful entering the dendritic and epithelial cells, explaining bacterial replication and inflammation of placenta [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With a rough LPS on the surface, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> triggers TLR-2 and TLR-4 which could potentially explain initial immune response detectable by indirect diagnostic tools, but still low concentration of bacteria for the direct isolation. <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic> also has rough LPS. Though, so far there have been no proof that <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic> based vaccines can protect dogs against <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection. Once in the cell, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> preserved most of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) characteristics present in highly pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species, to modify the cellular compartments, and delay the apoptosis signalling [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Slow metabolism and replication, absence of functional <italic toggle="yes">gadBC</italic> gene (glutamic acid decarboxylase gene for the resistance to low pH values) and alteration of apoptosis would explain prolonged localization of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> within cells, often within sequestered tissues. The prolonged intracellular cycle could explain lengthy antibiotic therapy, low success rates of the treatment and relapses in infected dogs. Since stealthiness mechanisms, used by other pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp., such as production of PAMPs, Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins, or positively charged core sugars, still have not been identified in <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> it is unclear how it shuts both TLR-2 and TLR-4 signalling, maintaining stealthiness [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Yet, upon experimental infection of DH82 canine macrophages, TLR-3, -7, and -8 are activated in time-dependent manner with the TLR-7 being the most expressed, but not TLR-2 nor TLR-4 [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, IFN-gamma, IL-4 nor IL-2 were not expressed in significant concentrations, similarly to another experimental infection of mice when <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> was compared to <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>. This would explain lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted when macrophages are infected with <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, compared to <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, but also higher replication rates in dendritic and epithelial cells compared to latter <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, just like <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> possess all the mechanisms to hinder maturation of dendritic cells and alter adaptive immune response, which could explain how, infected dogs can transmit the disease even without developing the disease . <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is zoonotic, however, the virulence of the bacterium to humans is not fully elucidated either [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, many of these deductions yet have to be tested and there are still many unknowns regarding the <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, especially as an emerging potential public health threat in Europe. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the detection of bacteria. In the case of subclinical canine brucellosis, the biopsies of predilected tissues are unjustified, while diagnosis from blood is challenging both with indirect and direct methods. The imperfect diagnostic accuracy of serological tests coupled with and intermittent bacteraemia make culture from blood an unreliable isolation and diagnostic method.</p>
      <p>Another challenging factor, relatively new from the point of view of infectious animal disease professionals, is dealing with a largely private, non-commercial, layperson group of owners when compared to farmers and with limited legal options for competent authorities. Compared to other diseases like rabies, the legal options to control movements and trade are limited or unclear for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected animals. Moreover, effective communication to all stakeholders involved is challenging, especially with respect to a zoonotic infection in companion animals and for dogs which may be infectious without showing clinical signs.</p>
      <p>The main goal of this paper is to give a state-of-the-art update on the European situation with regard to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, to present current knowledge gaps and with two different scenarios demonstrate limitations in proposing guidelines to address the emergence and the disease spread.</p>

      <p>The presence of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection has been demonstrated in different countries of the world with the isolation of the etiological agent, while in others its presence has been suspected based on the serological response. Canine brucellosis has been reported as endemic in Central and South America, in Asia, and in the Southern USA [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In endemic countries, canine brucellosis due to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is especially common among stray dogs, and in shelter or in commercial breeding kennels [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When the disease is introduced into a kennel, it spreads rapidly [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11&#x2013;13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Reports of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infections in Europe currently largely reflect the occurrence of clinical symptoms either in dogs or humans. There has been no systematic or cross-sectional study performed in any European country to evaluate the prevalence of this disease. The lack of data and surveillance programmes does not currently allow for an exact understanding of countries where the disease might be considered endemic. Since 2017, increasing numbers of sporadic cases, clusters, or outbreaks have been reported in different EU countries, including Switzerland, Ukraine, the Netherlands, the UK, and Turkey [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x2013;18</xref>] (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Retrospective, laboratory data collected from samples submitted in a non-systemic manner between 2016 and 2022, from 20 countries (mainly from Western Europe), indicate that 3.7% (61/1657) of samples subjected to laboratory veterinary diagnosis for brucellosis testing led to the detection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. DNA, with positive samples coming mainly from Spain (11.1% of the samples submitted), Poland (6.7% of the samples submitted), and more rarely from Italy and France [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since in this study commercial PCR kit for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. detection was used, which has not yet been validated by competent authorities. Moreover, the non-systematic sample submission, with very uneven representation of different countries, means that it is not possible to use the results for any formal estimation of prevalence. Currently, pre- or post-import testing of dogs for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is not required in Europe, so laboratory detection usually follows clinical disease manifestations, if the veterinarian is sufficiently informed and aware of it. Moreover, there is no mandatory testing scheme in any EU country. For policy makers, there is indeed a considerable difference between (risk of) emergence, outbreak, or endemic situation. This impacts the risk assessment in terms of dissemination, frequency, perennity of the disease and drives management decision making, as well as the level of any policy engagement. Recent data highlighted movements of dogs between kennels and countries as a major source of disease circulation, given the absence of sanitary control before and after travel. Movements of dogs between countries and online trade have increased during the last years, especially during the COVID pandemics. Recent risk assessments from the UK, France, and Finland [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have led to regulations changes in these countries (such as control of imported dogs or making cases reportable), since recommendations are decided on a country level. Additionally, canine brucellosis is not a notifiable disease for the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH, founded as OIE) and EU countries, which negatively impacts on the reporting of positive cases, whereas in the UK now, positive laboratory results for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> have been made reportable.

      <p>In Western European countries, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has historically not been regarded as endemic, as defined by the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area. However, there is no clear definition when a country is considered endemic for canine brucellosis. In the European Union, laboratory testing is only done in animals travelling to countries that mandate a set of blood tests (including <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>) for all pet dogs entering their territories, such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, or after a veterinary request following clinical disease (non-specific bacterial culture investigations or specific <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> serological testing). Serologically positive reactions are not systematically reported to competent authorities. However, some studies carried out in the last decade showed that this bacterial infection may be present even if no strains have been isolated. For instance, in 2013/2014, a study including 62 dogs from different kennels in the Lisbon region was carried out, and 6 animals (9.7%) were diagnosed as positive in both serological (Rapid Slide Agglutination Test &#x2013; RSAT, 2 mercapto-ethanol RSAT &#x2013; RSAT-ME and Complement Fixation Tests &#x2013; CFT with rough antigen) and molecular tests (Ferreira AC, personal communication). More recently, in 2018/2019, a follow-up was performed in two kennels with epidemiologically linked dogs. The study included 19 animals, 16 adults (tested twice at 3 months interval) and 3 young dogs (tested once). Nine out of 16 adult dogs (56.2%) were positive in serological and/or molecular tests. The clinical investigations identified one dog with cervical spondylosis and two females with history of abortion and embryonic resorption at day 45 of pregnancy. The three puppies were serologically negative but PCR positive for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. (Ferreira AC, personal communication).</p>
      <p>In France, canine <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> cases are on the rise as well. During the last 2 years more than 900 dogs have been reported to be at high exposure risk, from more than 250 owners throughout the country. Out of all tested animals, 170 cases had positive indirect diagnostic result from which strain isolation was attempted (C. Ponsart &amp; A. Ferreira Vicente, personal communication) The infection was confirmed in 31 dogs by strain isolation (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>In Italy, a major <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> brucellosis outbreak was first reported in 2020 in a large commercial breeding kennel [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the first round of serological tests of 598 animals, 269 (46.1%) tested serologically positive. In the second round of laboratory tests performed 4&#x2013;5 weeks later, the number of tested dogs that were serologically positive was 241 out of 683 sampled (35.3%), while the number of dogs from which a strain was isolated was 68 out of 683 tested (10.0%). Before this outbreak, the only report recorded in Italy was a presumptive <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection in a dog with chronic prostatitis and discospondylitis, detected by PCR [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The study also highlighted the need to increase the <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> genome database for molecular epidemiological surveillance, as well as the need to better control the dog movements and testing for canine brucellosis, especially for animals commercialized for breeding purposes.</p>
      <p>In the UK, until recently, there had been only sporadic cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> identified, linked to pet trade with Eastern Europe [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, a rapidly increasing number of suspect canine brucellosis due to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> have been reported by private veterinarians and/or veterinary laboratories, following clinical suspicion and/or laboratory identification (bacteriology, serology, or PCR) since July 2020 [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As of February 2020 until the end of 2022, more than 100 epidemiologically distinct cases of canine brucellosis (confirmed and probable based on laboratory, clinical and epidemiological investigations), including one large household cluster in England with evidence of dog-to-dog transmission, have been reported [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). New cases continue to be reported on a regular basis &#x2013; mainly related to importation or overseas travel (J. McGiven, personal communication). A review of domestic dog commercial import data by the UK government found that by the end of November 2020, commercial dog imports from Romania had increased in that year alone by 51% compared to 2019, with 29,348 dogs brought into the country [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Investigations conducted in the Netherlands in 18 seropositive and epidemiologically linked dogs showed that many of these animals had been imported from Eastern European countries, in which, according to cases identified in dogs imported into Western Europe, canine brucellosis could be endemic (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most animals suffered from lameness and neck or back pain (14 animals, 78%); while discospondylitis was diagnosed in 11 dogs [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>In Sweden, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> was first detected in 2011 in a female dog with reproductive disturbances. The dog had been mated in Poland to a Serbian and to a Polish dog [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A second known cluster was detected in dogs mated to a dog imported from Spain [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A third confirmed cluster occurred in 2020: a male dog, imported from the Netherlands and serologically positive for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> had mated a female dog imported from Mexico. The female dog aborted, but was never tested for brucellosis and was put to sleep (Lahti E, personal communication).</p>
      <p>In Germany, abovementioned non-systemic study found no positive dogs out of 386 tested by molecular tests (PCR) [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additional clinical investigations identified four young dogs (aged 7&#x2013;30 months), imported from Moldova, Romania, and North Macedonia, with discospondylitis in Germany, of which <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> could be isolated in three cases (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Human <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis is infrequently reported in the scientific literature from endemic countries, but given the generally mild and non-specific nature of human infections and the lack of awareness and validated tests for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in humans, cases are probably underreported globally [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, some cases can be severe, especially in more vulnerable individuals [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently the first human cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis have been reported in the 2021 in the Netherlands, and in 2022 in the UK, both related to people with significant exposure to canine reproductive excrements [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

        <title>Recommendations</title>
        <p>To fill the surveillance gaps, representative epidemiological surveys in Europe would be required to assess the prevalence of the disease within a defined confidence interval. To choose the best sampling strategy, the number of human and canine clinical cases as well as results of tested dogs, epidemiologically linked with confirmed cases, would have to be taken into account. Furthermore, epidemiological questionnaires would ensure data collection for the analysis of risk factors. With this knowledge, endemic countries would have the evidence needed to consider control programmes to prevent further dissemination of the disease. This could include mandatory notifications, movement restrictions, and control measures in positive kennels. Since transport of dogs to and between EU countries, but not within country, is mandatory to report, it would be possible to trace back the routes and include it in the risk management schemes. Centralized data collection could be used for intelligent tracing and, with enough cases, forecasting, to prevent disease dissemination and better develop management strategies. A multivariate risk factors analysis could give insights into whether restriction of movement can restrain the spread of the disease, in which conditions and what are the risks for public health.</p>

        <title>Clinical diagnostic</title>
        <p>Well-known and described manifestations of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection in dogs are discospondylitis, reproductive disorders, back pain, unilateral, or bilateral lymph node enlargement, as well as prostatitis and epididymitis in males, and late abortion in pregnant females. Most live-born puppies die within a few hours or days; those that survive normally show a generalized increase in lymph node volume, which is the main symptom until they reach sexual maturity [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In some dogs with chronic <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection, the onset of recurrent anterior uveitis with corneal oedema has also been described [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as polyarthritis [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2" id="S003-S2002">
        <title>Isolation and identification of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic></title>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is a small aerobic Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium with a rough cell wall antigen [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The unequivocal diagnosis of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection in dogs is only possible via the isolation and identification of the bacterium itself from material derived from the animal in question. The diagnostic sensitivity of this approach is dependent on a variety of factors such as the sample type, the stage of infection, the handling of the sample and the bacteriological methods employed. Classical bacteriological methods for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> culture are effective at detecting the target if viable cells are present in the material [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Automated culturing, such as VITEK-2 can also identify cultures as <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but results should be confirmed with additional techniques.</p>
        <p>The confirmation of bacterial genus identity can be done by mainstream MALDI-ToF [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] &#x2013; noting that it is imperative that the correct database is in place; &#x2013; by 16S rRNA sequencing [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. PCR [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Laboratories that suspect the growth of a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> isolate should take appropriate precautions with respect to any further manipulation to protect human health and prevent accidental infections. The speciation of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> isolates can be done by classical bio-typing and/or by various molecular methods including PCRs such as SNP based PCR typing [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and multiplex &#x201C;Bruce ladder&#x201D; PCR [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or by HRM PCR [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
        <p>The optimal material for recovery of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> from an infected animal is fresh abortion or parturition material. This is due to the number of bacterial cells which may be up to 10<sup>10</sup>/ml [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Vaginal swabs from females that have recently given birth or aborted may also yield positive results for up to 5 weeks [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but sensitivity will decrease substantially over time as bacterial numbers decline [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The culture of urine and semen samples from infected males may yield good sensitivity especially when clinical signs related to the reproductive organs are observed [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
        <p>In many cases, however, these samples are not available and bacteriology on blood samples is the only practical option. Blood samples should be collected into sodium citrate to avoid clotting and to prevent the inhibition of bacterial growth [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although not optimal, targeted <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> culture from blood is more commonly used for dogs than for livestock. This may be most effective if the infection is relatively recent and because of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> recurrent bacteraemia. Maximizing the sensitivity of this approach involves liquid culture with periodic sub-culture onto solid media. Estimates of sensitivity for this approach and the duration of bacteraemia are mixed and much of the data are derived from experimental studies conducted between 1960s and 1980s [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] rather than from natural infections. These studies demonstrate that, under experimental circumstances, blood culture is sensitive and bacteraemia prolonged. More recently, the sensitivity of blood culture was assessed from an investigation of the first reported outbreak of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in a kennel in Italy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this example, from a total of 683 kennel dogs sampled, 68 (9.6%) were <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> positive by culture from whole blood, whereas 241 (35.3%) were serologically positive (of which 64 were blood culture positive, 26.5%). Broth techniques with regular subculture onto solid media were applied. The diagnostic specificity of the serological method used (mSAT) was reported as 96.5%.</p>
        <p>Quantifying the diagnostic sensitivity of bacterial culture on whole blood samples from natural infections is challenging, as this method is considered the &#x201C;gold standard&#x201D; against which the sensitivity of all other methods is calculated. This is because for now, only bacterial culture shows 100% specificity and is the only method to demonstrate the presence of live and potentially infectious bacteria. It is the best method for the diagnosis of early infection in dogs that have not received antibiotic treatment. Unfortunately, a negative result does not rule out the infection, since the bacteria temporarily may not be present in the cultured sample [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This view is supported by data from studies where blood culture was undertaken in a population of dogs at high risk of infection, on the basis of epidemiology, clinical signs and serology (even if the precise infection status of each animal is not definitively known). A study of samples from 298 dogs, considered to be at high risk of infection, identified 74% to be serologically positive by RSAT (using a <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> M-antigen &#x2013; see below for further comment), but only 19% to be blood culture positive (although it was not specified if broth or solid culture was used, the former being more sensitive) [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the same study, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> was isolated in 16.4% of the 73 urine samples cultured (all from males).</p>
        <p>Overall, the data suggest that bacterial culture from blood, semen [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or vaginal swabs [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is a useful but limited diagnostic tool, as it is not sufficiently reliable to determine the infection status of individual animals unless the results are positive. The application of this approach is valuable for confirmation on a &#x201C;pack&#x201D; or &#x201C;kennel&#x201D; level, where serology could be used to determine the infection status of an individual animal. Culture also has considerable value in enabling in depth molecular epidemiological approaches to be enacted.</p>

        <title>Molecular detection of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic></title>
        <p>A series of studies by Lara Keid&#x2019;s group have demonstrated that the application of conventional PCR to whole blood samples can match and, in some cases, exceed the diagnostic efficacy of bacterial culture[<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, in some circumstances PCR had a distinct edge by detecting both live and dead cells [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This portfolio of work includes the investigation of primers targeted to IS711 and to ribosomal DNA using different extraction methods. Such methodological details are important, as are specific laboratory factors such as cleanliness of PCR workflows and these provide a wide opportunity for variation between methods that affects diagnostic performance. This whole process is integral to the PCR approach and validated diagnostic specificity and sensitivity values are specific only to the particular application and are not transferable to others.</p>
        <p>In the investigation of the outbreak in the kennel in Italy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a commercial PCR kit (<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> genus, Genesig&#xAE;, Advanced Kit) was used. Unfortunately, the target and primer sequences are not disclosed by the manufacturer, nor a commercial extraction method to obtain DNA samples from blood. In total, 32 of 683 samples were PCR positive (4.7%), approximately half the number that were culture positive although just over half the PCR positive samples were from culture negative samples from blood. To the authors&#x2019; best knowledge, this is the only published study on <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> to have generated useful validation data on a real-time PCR approach from naturally infected dogs.</p>
        <p>In another study [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], diagnostic sensitivity (DSn) of PCR was as high as 69.8%, diagnostic specificity (DSp 95.6%), using primers from the 16S&#x2013;23S interspacer region [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, this value was derived from just 122 of the 297 samples used to generate the DSn value for culture and it is not clear how this subsample was selected. Results from the same samples using PCR derived from the <italic toggle="yes">IS711</italic> element had significantly inferior DSn, 22.8% (DSp 99.7%) a result that was incorrectly attributed to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> having a low copy number of the targeted region. <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has been reported to have six <italic toggle="yes">IS711</italic> copies per genome [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which is significantly greater than the single copies available for most other targets (although there will also be multiple copies of 16s targets per cell), and PCR (especially real time PCR) based on alternative primers derived from this target have been reported as having superior sensitivity [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
        <p>As with bacterial culture, the success of PCR depends on the homogeneity of bacterial distribution in the sampled tissue. The samples are often homogenized and one quantity used for bacterial culturing, while other part, often smaller in volume or mass, is used for PCR. Even if the primers, probes and PCR conditions themselves are rooted in solid science, all these factors impact DSn. Therefore, we have to rely on indirect detection of specific antibodies, to fill the diagnostic gap when it is important to minimize false negatives.</p>

        <title>Indirect detection methods</title>
        <p>Since <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> isolation may be compromised by intermittent bacteraemia, serological methods have a central role in the diagnosis of canine brucellosis. Unfortunately, the sero-diagnostic landscape for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> is still relatively complicated. Sensitivities and specificities of serological tests vary greatly. As a rough <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp., <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> does not share the outer O-polysaccharide (OPS) &#x2013; the primary sero-diagnostic antigen used for detection of infection with smooth species, associated with livestock. Three major questions arise on this topic: (1) there is no consensus on a specific strain of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> from which to derive diagnostic antigens (or even if this species strains are necessary); (2) which specific antigens are most important or which are the best platforms for them to be applied to; (3) no international scientific community consensus on serological testing strategies according to the stage of infection. There is no WOAH chapter to cover <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> and no international standard anti-<italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> serum (although an EU standard is available to members) to promote laboratory harmonization and maintain minimum analytical standards. Canine brucellosis is not notifiable to the WOAH, but with increased international movements of dogs and this disease becoming more common [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], guidance on best practice would be welcome.</p>
        <p>Most reviews on <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> contain a summary of sero-diagnosis. However, the plethora of antigens and platforms makes it difficult to pigeonhole any one approach and many reviews themselves rely on secondary data. A chief example of where misunderstandings arise is the attribution of the specificity shortcomings of antigens derived with M+ (mucoid) strains &#x2013; and the tests using them &#x2013; to antigens derived with M- (less mucoid) strains as the latter are much more specific [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, p.198] albeit potentially a little less sensitive. Platforms may be the same, for example RSAT (Rapid Slide Agglutination Test) or TAT (Tube Agglutination Test)/SAT (Serum Agglutination Test) but with different antigens the diagnostic properties are very different. Given the nature of the infection, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> public health risks and the emotional distress caused to pet owners when results are positive it is imperative that these tests reach an acceptable level of diagnostic competency.</p>
        <p>The variety of different antigen and platform types have been summarized in <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Different platforms include: RSAT (with or without 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME)), TAT/SAT (with or without 2ME) and microtiter plate versions &#x2013; mSAT, AGID (Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion test), CFT (Complement Fixation Test), LFIA, IFA, and iELISA. These platforms detect different antibody isotypes with varying sensitivity as shown in the central column of <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Different antigens (applied to one or more of the above platforms) include whole cell (RSAT and TAT/SAT) and cytoplasmic and cell wall antigens (AGID) from <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> M+, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> M&#x2013;, or <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic>. For ELISA, the antigens evaluated include cytoplasmic and cell wall antigens but also recombinant proteins and rLPS extracts. Antigens used for immuno-comb, IFA as well as antigens used for most of the LFIAs on the market are not described.

Although the data in the table is a useful guide, it is not possible to use this to make direct comparisons between tests as the provenance of the samples used for each study may vary. There may often be incorporation bias (where a culture positive animal has been identified on the basis of positive serology), thus leading to an overestimate of sensitivity, or samples have been determined to be from infected (or uninfected) dogs on the basis of positive (or negative) serological results, also leading to an overestimate of sensitivity (or specificity).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
        <p>The diagnostic performance of each platform is also summarized in <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In some cases (e.g. TAT/SAT), it is not possible to provide an estimate of DSn or DSp as the published data does not enable a single point value for each. However, a qualitative assessment has been presented which concludes that the test is at best moderate for one parameter whilst being poor for the other (which depends on the application of 2ME) and has lower efficacy with samples from chronically infected animals [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], most likely due to the inferior agglutinating properties of IgG compared to pentameric IgM. The available validation data on this platform is currently limited to the use of M+ [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] antigens although the test has been implemented with M&#x2013; antigens (McGiven, personal communication).</p>
        <p>There have been several studies conducted using the RSAT platform (<xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with the DSp and DSn (in particular) variations between 70%&#x2013;100% and 83%&#x2013;100%, respectively. However, the impression emerges that the use of M&#x2013; <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> antigen is superior and that the addition of 2ME has a substantial negative effect on DSn. The AGID platform has been lauded for its superior DSp but the bottom range for the DSn is disturbingly low although there is considerable variation in antigen types applied. The CFT, as used for <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic>, has also been repurposed for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, however, validation data is very limited, and anti-complimentary reactions have been described as frequent.</p>
        <p>More modern techniques such as Immuno-comb and IFA have been developed. However, validation or even descriptive data on these are very limited, and it is therefore hard to evaluate their performance and thus difficult to recommend. More recently, many ELISAs and also LFIAs (Lateral Flow Immunoassay) have been developed. Whereas the precisions about the diagnostic antigen used for LFIAs are missing for many commercial tests (with the exception of Chemtest), the ELISAs have been better described in this regard (<xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>A summary of the evaluation for each of the sero-diagnostic methods is presented in <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. It should be emphasized that it is impossible to present a complete picture within a summary as, for example, the selection criteria used to select the samples for validation has a big impact on the outcome. For example, the DSn and DSp data for the Chemtest ELISA [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] looks extremely strong but it should be noted that the data were generated using serum panels that were already serologically negative (DSp) or positive (DSn) in RSAT and AGID. Generating data that is totally unbiased is extremely difficult, so it is important that authors are clear what the qualifying criteria are for the validation sample sets. The Chemtest ELISA does deserve particular attention as it is one of the few published assays that are commercially available (at the time of writing).

The analysis shows that IFA (Megacor) has 78 times higher analytical sensitivity than iELISA and more than 100 times higher, than the next most sensitive test &#x2013; mSAT, homemade at EURL.

        <p>The advent of Lateral Flow Immunoassays is a positive development as there is a clear and beneficial application for portable testing, for example in veterinary practice, breeding kennels, importers/exporters, and rescue charities. LFIAs may also have a place as a screening assay, whereby positive samples should be sent to a laboratory for further confirmatory testing. <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> includes the four LFIA products for which validation data has been published.</p>
        <p>In the absence of OPS (and therefore sLPS), it may be asking too much of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> sero-diagnostics to match the sensitivity and specificity of the RBT (Rose Bengal Test) and sLPS-based iELISAs used for the serodiagnosis of brucellosis in livestock [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the detectability of the EU standard serum (EUDBSS) between the platforms. The application of the best current approaches for the detection of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection still leaves uncomfortable levels of uncertainty (especially in particular groups) with respect to false-positive and false-negative results. No method should be expected to be perfect. A strategy to detect acute or chronic <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection is advantageous and therefore combining an agglutination assay (IgM) with an iELISA or LFIA (IgG) and/or mSAT has merit as long as the diagnostic parameters are acceptable. In this regard, the use of M+ antigens and 2ME should be avoided as the former generates an unnecessary level of false positives and the latter too many false negatives. AGID assays have high specificity but, as with use of 2ME, diagnostic sensitivity is too low for use on an individual animal basis.</p>
        <p>The interpretation of the results should be accompanied by an understanding of the epidemiological context, for example &#x2013; in combination with other risk factors (clinical symptoms, travel history, transmission opportunity). Even treatment is an extreme response (cost, duration, side effects). For example, the impact of an incorrect diagnosis and improper action can have far greater consequences for breeding dogs than for neutered animals. Dogs that are in regular contact with young children or immunocompromised persons may also present a greater risk to human health if not handled correctly.</p>

This might be changing as pet ownership has increased [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and the infection also appears to have spread further in dog population and into new geographical areas. The communication of this increased threat, particularly to those with strong interests in controlling it (owners, vets, breeders, etc.) may increase demand, stimulate more commercial interest which may lead to better availability of good commercially available tests. Part of this communication should be the message that validation data is an important aspect of test selection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An emphasis should be placed on the effective and transparent validation of applied methods so that appropriate tests are used and the uncertainties around their results are known and can be accounted for.

      <title>Transmission routes</title>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> can be transmitted by venereal routes, as well as via contact with body fluids through ingestion or via contact with broken skin or the mucosa [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. If cohabitating, a dog with canine brucellosis can transmit the disease to healthy dogs within a few weeks to months [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Genital secretions from dogs infected with <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> contain high bacterial loads, and dog-to-dog transmission primarily occurs during breeding or after contact with uterine discharges, semen, and aborted material. <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> shedding in semen is highest during the first 8 weeks after infection, but intermittent shedding can last for years [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Puppies can be infected by intrauterine vertical transmission or by drinking milk of infected females [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Other body fluids including saliva, nasal, and ocular secretions and urine may also contain bacteria, although in lower loads, rendering contact with these fluids a possible transmission route as well.</p>
      <p>Although the bacterial load in urine (up to 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/ml [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) is lower than in genital discharges (up to 10<sup>10</sup> bacteria [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), the risk of exposure to urine may be greater and therefore it does potentially play a major role in transmission. After becoming infected, the urinary bacterial load increases, and it is highest after 1 to 4&#x2013;6 months after infection [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In general, urine from male dogs contain higher <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> loads than from females [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Infected neutered animals cannot show reproductive signs, but a recent case study showed that both intact and neutered dogs shed <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in urine (31% and 33%, respectively) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting that neutered dogs can also transmit the disease via urine. This is due to the localization of the bacteria in the prostate of males. However, the presence of canine urine in various environmental conditions, whether bacteria survive in those conditions, and even more importantly, for how long urine stays infectious, remains to be elucidated. This is of utmost importance especially for the risk management and future recommendations on measures to be taken to stop the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in urine emerges from prostatic secretions of adult males [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but recent evidence revealed a pantropic distribution of the bacterium and its presence was confirmed in the kidneys as well [<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A number of cases have been described in which puppies were involved in the transmission of canine brucellosis [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on the pantropic distribution of the bacterium in neonates and the absence of abortion and mating in these puppies, some studies hypothesize that young puppies can spread the infection indirectly via urine, faeces, or skin [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hence, indirect transmission by both young and adult neutered animals can play a more prominent role than previously thought.</p>
      <p>Transmission via indirect routes depends largely on the persistence of the bacterium in the environment, since it should be able to invade the host after remaining extracellular for prolonged time periods. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species have been described to survive in water, food, soil, pastures, and manure for up to 8 months, although this is dependent on humidity, exposure to sunlight, the availability of organic matter and temperature [<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Survival is longer at low temperatures. <italic toggle="yes">B. microti</italic> has been isolated from soil samples 7 years after primary identification, indicating that soil might function as a constant source of infection [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Despite some historic data, currently there are still many unknowns around how <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> survives in various environmental conditions (humidity, soil temperatures, types of soil, etc.). Further it is unclear to what extent, if any, the absence of OPS from the outer membrane of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> impacts environmental survival (and susceptibility to disinfection) in comparison to smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp.</p>
      <p>Due to the role that fomites may have in the transmission of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, preventive measures can help in minimizing the risk of spread. For example, disinfection procedures, separate feeding/drinking bowls, the use of personal protective equipment, separate areas for animals around delivery, can minimize the transmission of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infections. If an infection is suspected, the biosecurity measures between areas should be implemented (different clothing, boot protection, etc.). However, not all dog owners are aware or trained in application of these preventive measures. To raise awareness, improve the public health protection and prevent further spread of the disease, depending on the epidemiological situation, commercial breeders, charity kennels, and adoption centres workers, as well as private owners should be informed and thought about preventive measures.</p>

        <p>Currently, as soon as dogs are diagnosed with <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, one recommendation is to neuter them, if they have not been already, to decrease excretion of the bacteria and to avoid further reproductive contacts. However appropriate mitigations must be in place to protect the surgical team, due to the exposure risk this activity may present. Additional longitudinal studies would be necessary to evaluate the risks of non-reproductive contact as well as the effects of neutering and gender, on further dissemination of the disease under varied scenarios with respect to housing and animal lifestyle. Since these animals would still pose the risks for further dissemination and public health, based on current data, the extent of these risks cannot be estimated. Therefore, initial laboratory trials on bacterial (both non- and mucoid strains) survival and/or infectivity in various conditions (environmental, cellular infection models, etc.) would be of utmost importance to determine the restrictions these dogs would be subjected to, which would greatly improve risk management decisions as well.</p>

      <title>Risks for human health</title>
      <p>Humans can acquire <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection through direct contact with fluids or tissues of infected dogs, especially via genital secretions, aborted and parturition materials, urine, or blood of infected dogs [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Usual clinical symptoms correspond to ones caused by other zoonotic <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species may be chronic including fever (sometimes undulant), chills, headaches, sweats, joint pain, peripheral lymphadenopathies, and splenomegaly, while in severe cases it can cause the endocarditis and affect central nervous system [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Damaged skin, mucous, or respiratory membranes are presumed points of infection. The infection should be suspected in patients with compatible symptoms, negative serology with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> antigen [<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and a history of contact with dogs. Contact with a joint fluid of infected dogs, obstetric surgery, neutering, and semen collection can pose a risk of professional exposure to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Even M-strains used for antigen production, of low virulence for dogs, can cause clinical brucellosis in laboratory workers a few days after exposure [<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], the case indicating the dose-dependent manner of infection. It is evident that the lack of knowledge about brucellosis, in addition to direct contact with animal fluids, and failure to comply with the use of personal protective equipment and biosafety standards, increase the probability of infection [<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In 2012, one <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection case of a child and dog in New York, exposed 31 laboratory workers to isolated culture [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Five job-related groups are considered at high risk of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>-caused brucellosis: rural workers living in close contact with stray/farm dogs, kennel owners and workers, veterinarians and veterinary assistants, laboratory workers and hunters. Since canine companions have a special place in many households and cultures, their presence within the households exposes the most vulnerable categories (i.e. children, elderly or immunocompromised persons) to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection.
<fig position="float" id="F0001"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Currently known <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> transmission routes for human infections.

      <p>Human <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infections have been described in Europe, North and South America [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], Hawaii [<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], Japan [<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], China [<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and Malaysia [<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In Europe, only recently, human cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>-caused brucellosis were reported in the Netherlands &#x2013; a 55-year-old kennel owner without non-specific clinical symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; in Germany &#x2013; a 30-year-old female patient with recurrent fever and so-called granulomatous hepatitis and splenomegaly [<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; and in the UK &#x2013; a 61-year-old woman who contracted an infection with clinical symptoms from an imported dog, leading to hospitalization for more than 2 weeks [<xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>
      <p>The first human cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection were described from Texas four decades apart, where 48-year-old man had an intermittent fever and bacteraemia over a 4-month period [<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The youngest ever recorded case was of a 17-month-old child, also from Texas [<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In humans, the symptoms of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis vary depending on age and immune status. In children with inherited diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> can cause arthritis, lymphadenopathy or septic arthritis, or preconditioned with other types of inflammations causes mycotic aneurysms [<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In previously healthy children, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> may cause a plethora of symptoms ranging from fever and dyspnoea [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to cardiac inflammations aneurysms of extremities, calvarial osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, pleural effusions, and pulmonary nodules [<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In adults, symptoms can be so mild that the infection can go undiagnosed even for several decades [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similarly, a presumptive case of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> causing endocarditis was described in Israel [<xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In immunocompromised patients, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection can cause serious consequences [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Fortunately, after timely diagnosis and antibiotic therapy, in children, healthy or HIV-infected adults it seems that <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis does not influence general health conditions, nor has long-term impacts [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
      <p>Based on current data, without reliable diagnostic tools, it is estimated that <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has a low zoonotic risk [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given the few reported cases, rare development of unspecific clinical symptoms, very low mortality rate [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and resolution of the disease with antibiotics, the absence of reliable diagnostic tools for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in humans, leads to a curtailed estimation of overall prevalence. However, the virulence of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in humans is untested. Systematic monitoring of canine cases and human brucellosis could clarify the number of exposures that result in infection, both clinical and subclinical, indicating an urgent need for the development of more reliable diagnostic tools.</p>
      <p>The absence of cross-reactivity between antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> and other <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. makes it complicated to adapt new, specific indirect diagnostic tests. Moreover, neither sensitivity nor limits of detection for any of the current direct or indirect methods have been analysed for diagnostics of human <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infections. Since approved diagnostic tests for human <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> serology are missing, several studies used tests developed for dogs. These results show that in humans, infection or exposure may be higher than previously thought. However, given the already limited standardization of sero-diagnostic tests for dogs, their application on human samples should be interpreted with caution [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Very few public health laboratories are aware that specific tests are needed to correctly diagnose human <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection, and therefore they need support from respective National Reference Laboratories (NRLs).</p>
      <p>Therefore, a One Health approach is necessary to address the need to update information on canine and human seroprevalence worldwide, elucidate the infectivity of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> for humans, and determine the most appropriate treatment and prevention strategies. In recent years, the worldwide growth of large urban populations has created a new set of global health challenges, to which <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> can be added. Changes in the urban environment due to the expansion of slum communities have resulted in increased dog populations, where uncontrolled breeding is common. There is currently no surveillance plan for canine brucellosis in humans at the EU level. Only individual cases in some countries are tested and reported. To fill the gaps in surveillance, epidemiological surveys would be needed to assess the prevalence of the disease. This would greatly improve reporting of cases, especially since recent studies, using Bayesian models estimate actual global rates of brucellosis to be closer to 2 million cases annually, rather than the 500,000 reported previously [<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p>

        <title>Recommendations</title>
        <p>The identification of specific <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> or rough <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigenic markers is urgently needed, to develop new indirect immunologic tests for humans and improve diagnostics. Many diagnostic laboratories nowadays use either MALDI-TOF or VITEK approaches to streamline, shorten, and assure quality control, of direct bacterial pathogen identification. To have the accurate identification to at least genus, if not species, level, enlarged libraries should be developed for MALDI-TOF, which would also decrease the number of errors of indirect diagnostics due to cross-reactivity with other bacteria (see section on Diagnostics). With reliable diagnostic tools, the prevalence of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> caused brucellosis in humans can be more precisely estimated, as well as the prevalence of infected but healthy individuals. Furthermore, validated diagnostic tools and awareness raising among clinicians would include <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in differential diagnosis, although nonspecific symptoms make it complicated, and therefore under reported without means to assess the risks. Long-term follow-up of confirmed canine clinical cases and investigation of epidemiological links would improve the evaluation of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> pathogenicity to humans and zoonotic risks: of horizontal transmission; of continuous bacteria shedding and their infectivity rate; as well as of handling the infected waste.</p>
        <p>If not timely diagnosed or left untreated <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection in humans may have long-lasting neural and cardiac symptoms, recurrent fevers, joint pain, fatigue, etc. Beside evident patient well-being, late <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> diagnosis in humans may have economic consequences through decreased work capabilities, while follow-ups and long antibiotic treatment can put the additional costs to health systems.</p>

      <title>Treatment and prophylaxis</title>
      <p>No vaccines are commercially available for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> and antimicrobial treatment of infected animals, when applied, is seen as an alternative to removal of animals and usually combined with animal sterilization. Cross-protection with other anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines, used for cattle and small ruminants, has been reported, but not considered practical, since it presents a risk of vaccine strain shedding in a domestic environment with current live vaccines retaining a degree of virulence for humans [<xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The treatment of infected dogs is a debated issue as antimicrobial therapy does not guarantee <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> elimination, with relapses of infection frequently reported in addition to the risks related to the development of antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, many owners consider their dogs as family members and have strong emotional bonds with them, which may lead to careful evaluation of sanitary measures (i.e. euthanasia versus antimicrobial treatment) being applied to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected animals and attempts to treat may represent the first choice for owners. This is even more exacerbated by the fact that there are few legal means to impose the management of infected dogs.</p>
      <p>Data from past studies on <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> efficacy of different antimicrobials against <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> suggest that tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones possess bactericidal activity against <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> and combination therapy is more effective than treatment using one antimicrobial group [<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Unfortunately, this <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> susceptibility does not always reflect the efficacy of treatment <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Data from the few <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies on antimicrobial efficacy for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection have been recently reviewed [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Therapeutic protocols based on a combination of tetracycline-based molecules, administered orally every day for 1 or 2 months, and aminoglycosides (dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin, or gentamicin), administered parenterally for 7 days in the first 1&#x2013;2 weeks of therapy and thereafter every 3&#x2013;4 weeks were associated with high percentages of recovery with bacteriological and serological negativity of treated animals. However, a retrospective review from 30 dogs treated between 2017 and 2022 in the USA concluded that although poly-antimicrobial treatment is most effective, relapses and persistent infections frequently occur and 3 of these 30 dogs were therefore maintained on antibiotics indefinitely [<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p>
      <p>Due to the potential toxicity of aminoglycosides, alternative protocols based on enrofloxacin monotherapy have been proposed [<xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Animals treated with 5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin orally every 12 h for 30 days with additional treatment of female animals during oestrual and luteal phases resulted in regression of clinical signs, absence of bacterial detection in treated animals and offspring and reduction of antibody titres.</p>
      <p>Data from these <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> studies are difficult to compare as experimental settings (i.e. sex and age of animals, stage of infection and therapeutic protocols administered) differed as well as criteria applied to define recovery (i.e. bacteriological vs serological negativity). Nevertheless, these data indicate that in some circumstances antimicrobial treatment is effective in clearing the infection and reducing the spread of bacteria and the combination of antimicrobial treatment of infected animals with sterilization would reduce the risks of disease spreading, especially in females. Less encouraging data are reported for males as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> persists in the prostate and other lymphoid tissues [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>One of the major concerns related to antimicrobial treatment of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected animals is relapses of infection. The frequency of relapses is generally considered high, however, precise data are difficult to obtain because of several variables that may influence the efficacy of treatment, such as the stage of the infection (acute versus chronic), bacterial localization, individual susceptibility to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection and immune competence, sex, and age. Furthermore, information on efficacy of antimicrobial treatments in the long term are scant due to the difficulties of constant monitoring of animals over the years. Moreover, when the relapses are recorded, the severity of the clinical symptoms is equal to the acute infection.</p>
      <p>Economic and management aspects of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected animals undergoing treatment represent additional issues. Dog owners have to be clearly informed on costs, duration (weeks) and possible inconvenience (relapses and repeated treatments) related to the therapy and the necessary follow-up of laboratory investigations to monitor the efficacy of therapy. Costs of treatment together with long-term management of infected animals need to be considered when the infection occurs in a breeding kennel with tens of individuals involved and outbreak control is based on a no-kill strategy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p>
      <p>In all instances when dog owners are unwilling to euthanize infected dogs or when a no-kill strategy is adopted, antimicrobial treatment, combined with neutering may represent the only alternatives to euthanasia but some gaps need to be filled. First, criteria to support the decision of treatment versus euthanasia are missing. Second, universally accepted treatment protocols for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected animals are not available and when antimicrobial therapy is considered, the choice of the antimicrobials and the duration of the treatment remain a decision of veterinary clinicians. The development of guidelines covering these aspects would facilitate decision making for the management of infected animals.</p>

        <title>Recommendations</title>
        <p>Attempts to develop vaccines should be encouraged particularly if there are an effective means by which vaccinated dogs can be differentiated from infected. A successful vaccine will reduce spread of disease and protect dog and human health.</p>
        <p>Efforts to robustly determine the most effective treatment options and define their efficacy should be encouraged. An effective treatment that eliminates the infection in a high proportion of dogs would provide positive options following a diagnosis, improve animal welfare, and reduce zoonotic risk.</p>
        <p>Measures should be taken to ensure that antibiotics are used only when necessary and responsibly. If treatment of dogs becomes a more frequent occurrence, then isolated <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> strains should more regularly be monitored for evidence of antibiotic resistance emergence. This will help prevent the emergence of a greater risk for human and dog health.</p>
        <p>Developing evidential knowledge to determine with high confidence if there is a positive effect of neutering on disease progression and non-reproductive transmission would require either experimental or a large quantity of highly detailed case studies.</p>
        <p>Having a better understanding of the risks presented by neutered infected for other dogs and humans would enable more effective decisions to be made about the management of such animals and their impact upon sustaining disease.</p>
        <p>Communications about <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection should contain clearer information about the potential costs and side effects of antibiotic treatment, to make better and earlier decisions with respect to the management of their dogs. The decisions would also need to factor in the uncertainties that currently exist with the likelihood of treatment success.</p>
        <p>Some veterinary consensus about treating asymptomatic dogs to reduce disease transmission and reduce the likelihood of disease emergence would be welcome. Given the existing uncertainties around the efficacy and side effects of treatment and issues relating to antimicrobial stewardship it is difficult to foresee consensus on this issue in the near future.</p>

      <title>Control &#x2013; regulations and legislation</title>
      <p>The notification status and the criteria for notification of canine brucellosis vary between countries in Europe. In some countries, the detection of the bacterium in an animal by culture or by molecular methods is reportable, while in others a positive serological response is reportable. Whether the competent authorities perform trace-back investigations of suspected or confirmed cases vary as well. The authorities may recommend control measures to contain an outbreak and prevent further transmission but due to the lack of legal powers the veterinary authorities often encounter difficulties enforcing control measures.</p>
      <p>Dogs have to conform to specific animal health requirements to travel and enable importation into the majority of countries of the world. The European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/692 to describe the conditions companion animals (dogs, cat, and ferrets) have to meet to grant the importation (2020). Accordingly, the following conditions must be met when dogs are imported from authorized non-EU countries (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/404). These animals must be from registered establishments under the control of the competent authority, with a system to maintain and to keep up-to-date animal health records, receiving regular animal health visits and not subject to any ban on animal health grounds (including rabies). Also, dogs must be marked by universal transponder chips. The same regulations are applied for the transport of dogs within the EU member states and described in the regulation 2020/688. Regarding the health status, dogs must be vaccinated against rabies, accompanied by a passport, have a health certificate issued by an official veterinarian and if entering Finland or Malta, be treated against <italic toggle="yes">Echinococcus multilocularis</italic>. Otherwise, currently there are no other measures in place to prevent the spread of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> by dogs in the EU. Only very recently, Iceland and now more and more EU countries have added <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free status as a requirement for import of dogs, while the UK recommends testing, but there are no legal powers to enforce this.</p>
      <p>The awareness of the importance of applying biosecurity routines may be low or variable among dog breeders. Further, the awareness of the importance of biosecurity measures is likely lower among dog owners than among the dog breeders.</p>

      <title>Two hypothetical cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection and subsequent management, based on present knowledge</title>
      <p>Two main scenarios are presented below to cover the two most common cases in Europe currently, suspected/confirmed infected individual pet dog in a household setting, and a kennel situation. The scenarios and subsequent management responses are based on the current knowledge, also highlighting current gaps that urgently have to be resolved. These scenarios may assist legislators/policy makers to consider what actions may be appropriate, proportionate, and effective in controlling disease. The scenarios have been created based on the authors&#x2019; experiences from various European countries. However, local authorities should consider further investigation and management steps taking into account the ongoing prevalence of disease, size and density of (local) dog population, level of presented risk, the risk appetite of the owners, veterinarians and authorities involved, as well as legal perimeters at their disposal.</p>
      <p>Currently, the presence of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has no impact on the countries&#x2019; official brucellosis status according to WOAH as this relates only to <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic>, in livestock (<italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has not been identified as a threat to livestock or brucellosis surveillance systems).</p>

        <title>Scenario 1: individual dog as a house pet</title>
        <p>If there is a suspicion of infection with or exposure to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, a dog in the household should be tested for potential infection. Within the same concept, in case of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> potential exposure or clinical symptoms, individual dogs should be tested as described in Diagnostics section, taking into account the epidemiological situation regarding the choice of diagnostic protocol.</p>
        <sec disp-level="3" id="S008-S2002-S3001">
          <title>Diagnostics</title>
          <p>Although canine brucellosis is associated with prominent clinical signs, dogs may show no symptoms at all. Bacteriology remains the gold standard to confirm the infection in these animals (see Diagnostics section). However, since sensitivity of bacterial culture from blood is low, and may not be possible, validated serological and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DNA detection methods can be used to complement the diagnosis (<xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Because bacteraemia is intermittent (currently, the frequency and the extent are not exactly known), and isolation of bacteria or detection of their DNA may have low diagnostic sensitivity. Therefore, serological methods provide the most diagnostically sensitive means to test the status of dogs. However, if serologically positive, multiple criteria have to be taken into account to determine whether the dog can be considered as infected or false positive (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In the case of recent infection, the antibody response may not yet have developed. Therefore, in the event of a negative results a further test, a minimum 6 weeks apart, is needed to properly assess the serological status of the animal (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The possibility of a false-positive result has to be considered as well, although this result has to be interpreted in light of other risk factors. The more risk factors are present, the more likely it is that a serologically positive result is true (the likelihood that a positive result is true is called the Positive Predictive Value and it will vary according diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested, when more risk factors are present the subject dog becomes a member of a population with a higher disease prevalence). Moreover, if the antibody value is high and remains consistent for at least 6 weeks, it can provide further evidence that the dog should be considered as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected. However, the possibility of coinfections cannot be excluded, although currently there are no real evidences suggesting that some other bacteria may cause false-positive <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> diagnosis. Hence, repeated sampling may help to exclude a false-positive and -negative reactions, and to follow antibody titre kinetics. If two different tests are used, it may increase diagnostic specificity, but the consequence will be lowered sensitivity, leading to false-negative results (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, if a quantitative test is used, it would help even further to interpret serological profiles.</p>
          <p>Principal issues related to definitive status definition: (1) Does a serologically positive result corresponds to an infected dog (true positive) or uninfected (false-positive serology &#x2013; cross reaction; low specificity). Does a positive serological test (not being FPSR) signify exposure, infection, infectiousness? (2) Does a negative result correspond to a dog free of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection? False-negative results may also occur (incubation period, low titters, low sensitivity of existing tests, etc.) and complicate the interpretation of a single negative result.</p>
          <p>A positive serological reaction cannot determine when a dog was in contact with <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, nor if the infection is still ongoing and to what extent the animal is infectious to others and humans. However, it shows that there is a risk of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> presence in the local population, and therefore a potential public health threat. Moreover, local authorities should consider further investigation and management steps taking into account the ongoing number of confirmed <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> canine cases, estimated prevalence, size and density of (local) dog population, specific epidemiological factors in each country, region or household, as well as legal perimeters at their disposal. Current state of the art forbids us to further elaborate on aforementioned problematics, so until further advances, each serologically positive dog should be considered as a threat for further dissemination, until proven that either the reaction was false positive (these conclusions could be supported by two consecutive negative results). In the case of high antibody titres (both IgG and IgM) &#x2013; presume acute infection, sampling for direct diagnosis could be recommended, since both diseased and asymptomatic dogs (especially males) are reported to excrete infectious bacteria. Due to the low sensitivity of direct methods, repeated sampling could be recommended to increase the sensitivity of overall approach (although this will be financially costly approach). Nevertheless, there are not enough data to estimate the optimal number of samples needed to have a high probability of isolation, nor how much this would improve the diagnostic sensitivity.</p>

          <title>Management of suspected dogs</title>
          <p>In case of non-conclusive results, and dogs that remain suspected of probably infected but not confirmed even more difficult judgment about risks will have to be made. The dog can be considered as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> positive to avoid the risk of disseminations and to preserve public health, but this decision has to be made in context of present risk factors. Accommodation in endemic countries or contact with infected animals can be considered as risk factors that argue to consider the dog as potential infected.</p>
          <p>Based on current knowledge of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> transmission routes, pathogenicity and lack of data to estimate infection rates in Europe, the management strategies should be curtailed to set of factors associated with each case or group. Such factors include ongoing number of confirmed <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> canine and human cases, estimated prevalence, size and density of (local) dog population, specific epidemiological factors in each country, region or household, as well as legal perimeters at disposal. Dogs in non-reproductive contact with an infected animal, i.e. those that share same social spaces, should be considered at risk of infection (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the nature of dogs&#x2019; social behaviour, provides potential transmission routes for infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, dogs in contact, from other private owners, could have a serological follow-up if epidemiological situation requires; at least two negative tests 4&#x2013;6 weeks apart. If the disease is endemic in the compartment, dog owners and veterinary clinicians should be informed of the potential risks, management rules, and regulations. The isolation of suspected animals should be recommended, at least in endemic countries, while relevant authorities should assess these risks in areas where the disease is sporadic (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

          <title>Management of confirmed infected dogs</title>
          <p>If a dog is <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected, an epidemiological investigation should be conducted, by competent authorities, to avoid further dissemination and public health risks (see Control &#x2013; Regulations and Legislation section) (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The epidemiological investigation will identify other dog(s) in close contact with the infected animal, which should be tested. Based on the epidemiological context, decision makers should determine the scale/perimeter of additional testing and measures. For these animals, at least serological tests are required to determine the presence/absence of specific antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>. In the case of a positive test result, the animal should be considered as potentially infected, otherwise a new test will be advised after 4&#x2013;6 weeks.</p>
          <p>Pet dogs may have multiple daily close contacts with animals from other households. These should be considered as contact dogs. The awareness of the need for biosecurity routines is presumably low among private owners (even when symptoms are present) (see Transmission Routes and Risks for Human Health sections). In addition, if semi-environmental exposure via urine (sniffing, licking, aerosols) is important, management becomes more complicated as the contaminated environment may become a direct source of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection (for more details, see Transmission Routes section).</p>
          <p>As discussed in Transmission Routes section, even after neutering, dogs can still excrete infectious bacteria via urine, especially if clinical symptoms are present. Likewise, as described in Treatment and Prophylaxis section, described antimicrobial treatments are aggressive, correct doses still have to be adjusted and side effects can be expected. For now, brucellosis in dogs is considered as a lifelong infection [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, even after treatment and initial recovery, bacteria can remain latent in some tissues, which may cause relapses after changes in the immune status of dogs, including possible re-excretion. Re-excretion of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> bares the risks of antimicrobial resistance development, but the data on this topic are scarce (see Treatment and Prophylaxis section). Furthermore, currently there are no vaccines available for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> in dogs. Since the risk of relapses of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> shedding exist, the care for the infected dog (isolation, travel ban, etc.) as well as waste management system should be defined and maintained during the life of that dog. Therefore, in the absence of effective treatment, the animal&#x2019;s wellbeing should be considered, especially in case of clinical relapses. Consequently, removal can be proposed. However, regulations in many countries oppose euthanasia as a solution for animals whose lives are not in danger or suffering by this disease is not proven.</p>
          <p>In the same time, public health officials should be informed about <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> incidents so that the appropriate protection and monitoring measures can be proposed in order to protect public health.</p>

The absence of specific antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has been reported in infected puppies and young dogs born to infected mothers.

        <title>Scenario 2: <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infected kennels</title>
        <p>For <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, two major risks in kennels are introduction of new animals and dissemination in the establishment and/or beyond. The number of dogs directly influences the size and space necessary for proper management of the infection risk. All facilities must have the possibility of individual isolation, without contact with the animals already present at the premises &#x2013; quarantine. If individual isolation is not possible, dogs can be separated in small groups that will be treated as epidemiological units. Considering the known kinetics of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection in dogs the advised period of quarantine should be at least 6 weeks. Therefore, the complete isolation of dogs during this period should be planned, taking into account the separated social space, walks, toys, feeding and toilet areas, as well as dedicated outdoor space for quarantined dogs.</p>
        <sec disp-level="3" id="S008-S2003-S3001">
          <title>Diagnostics</title>
          <p>Usually, the first reported sign of infection in a breeding kennel is likely to be an abortion(s), in which case the aborted material should be cultured for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, as described in Transmission Routes section. However, in the case of adoption centres for example, or dog hotels, where pregnant bitches are less frequent, isolation is more difficult. In any case, if there is a suspicion of contamination or exposure to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> inside a kennel, all dogs should be tested to determine the status of each animal, define epidemiological unit(s) and regroup infected and probably infected animal(s) (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, negative results should be treated with caution and multiple tests, at least 6 weeks apart should be performed in each epidemiological unit. Depending on the epidemiological situation, competent authorities may require two or three consecutive serologically negative results to consider a dog as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). If at least two reproductively active dogs are confirmed as serologically positive (at least two positive samples), the kennel should be considered as infected even without the isolation of the strain. This percentage should be adapted as new epidemiological data in a specific country or region become more readily available.</p>
          <p>As described in Transmission Routes section, depending on the breed/origin, the immune system in puppies and prepubescent dogs (0&#x2013;2 years old) is not yet fully developed and reaction to <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection not completely described. For this reason, it is recommended to verify the serological status of both parents (two negative serological results, 6 weeks apart), 3&#x2013;6 months before the introduction, until specific tests are available for the offspring. In the event of birth during the quarantine period, it is assumed that the puppy maintains the same serological status as the mother. In the case of puppies and young dogs of unknown origin (stray animals), epidemiological risk of infection should be evaluated first based epidemiological situation in the region/country and then on the group of dogs they spend the most time with.</p>

            <p>To avoid <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> introduction into the kennel, each new dog should be quarantined for 6 weeks before mixing with the other dogs (<xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). A dog can be considered as non-infected only after two consecutive negative serological tests at least 6 weeks apart, during the quarantine period (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For now, it is recommended to test the serological status upon arrival of the animal and before the end of the quarantine period. If possible, tests performed before the movement of dog(s) (previous kennel) can be used only to follow the serological status but not to prove the negativity, since the infection can occur during the transport (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Experimental infection models proved that the serological status could change during the 6 weeks post infection. During the quarantine period, the individual dog or group of dogs should not have interaction with other animals present in the kennel, nor have contact with the same playgrounds, feeding and water bowls or equipment. The kennel should be encouraged to apply stringent biosecurity routines: personal protection equipment for the persons working in the quarantine and other parts of the kennel, cleaning, and disinfection of the premises, no external visitors allowed to enter the quarantine (<xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). If the quarantined animals need to be taken to a veterinarian, preventive measures should be taken to avoid possible dissemination(s). Access to the collective social space should be eliminated, and unique space dedicated to quarantined dogs or an approved decontamination process is followed before and after. As a rule, quarantine should be finished only when all dogs present two successive negative serological results. If one or more animals become serologically positive for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic>, during the quarantine, the 6-week period should be restarted for other dogs (if applicable), after the isolation of individual positive case(s) (<xref rid="T0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>

            <title>Rules before sale/adoption</title>
            <p>To sell or adopt a dog, a negative serological test seven days in advance can be required to prove the health status (<xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). When a kennel is declared suspected, the sale or adoption of dogs should be stopped/discouraged. Similarly, movements of dogs should be prohibited from facilities with infected/suspected animals, even for seronegative dogs, until the disease has been eradicated or suspicion lifted, and the kennel is declared as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free. However, kennels that test regularly all animals and provide a proof of protective measures employed, could be labelled as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free. In cases of kennels labelled free and the use of appropriately authorized transporters (transport only individual dogs, respect the decontamination measures or strict separation during transport), quarantine in the new kennel would not be necessary. In the same way, for <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free kennels, adoption could take place without negative serological proof.</p>
            <p>As described above (see Treatment and Prophylaxis section), the adoption of a seropositive dog is strongly discouraged in the absence of effective treatment against the disease. However, in case removal is not possible and the adoption route is chosen, it should be strictly supervised to minimize the risk of human and other animal(s) infection(s). The animal should be neutered (with the risks of this procedure appropriately mitigated) and treated, its clinical conditions monitored regularly for the rest of its life and both the organization and the future owner must be informed of the risks and disease management plans.</p>
            <p>For all identified dogs in close contact with the infected kennel, serological follow-up should be organized as previously described. If only sporadic cases of <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> have been detected in the country/region, the quarantine and separation of dogs into groups may not need to be enforced, between two tests, but movement and contact with other dogs outside the kennel should be at least strictly followed, since the risk of infection is generally considered to be lower. In endemic areas, to prevent further dissemination of bacteria, dogs in kennels that had contact with the infected one(s), should also be quarantined, and grouped as described until two successive negative serological tests for each group.</p>

        <title>Management of infected or probably infected dogs</title>
        <p>The infected or probably infected dogs should be separated from non-infected animals (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Different scenarios are possible: 1 &#x2013; creation of an independent &#x201C;epidemiological unit&#x201D; within the facility (with biosecurity protocols); 2 &#x2013; isolation outside of the kennel (including adoption with informed consent) (<xref rid="T0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, both adoption organization(s) and future owners should be informed of a risk, management rules including follow-up testing. They would have to be informed that from current scientific data, the probability to detect a dog as infected or infectious is low, how the serological status of infected animals changes is also unknown, but also whether they harbour the infectious bacteria or not, nor the risks of further bacterial dissemination.</p>
        <p>When a kennel is confirmed as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> positive, an epidemiological investigation should be conducted to find the source of infection, avoid further dissemination and public health risks. All dogs present in the kennel should be tested individually and positive animal(s) should be separated. For a kennel, with a large number of animals, separation into small sub-groups could be an option. Each group should be followed, until all animals present two negative serological tests, at least 6 weeks apart. All kennels proven to be in epidemiological contact with the infected one, should automatically become suspect and all dogs tested.</p>
        <p>Kennel owners should clearly be informed about necessary sterilization, lifelong follow-up minimum once a year, no contact with uninfected dogs as well as specific waste management until further information about this disease in dogs is obtained. At the same time, it would include long and expensive and aggressive antimicrobial therapy.</p>
        <p>Follow-up of dogs sold in the at least 6 weeks prior to the first identified case, should be undertaken as well. After the first serological results, it is recommended to split dogs into small groups (depending on the size of the kennels), according to different sanitary status (infected, seropositive, seronegative, unknown, etc.). Furthermore, necessary instructions for owners, veterinarians and visitors should be distributed and clearly communicated. Hygiene procedures for working with infected, non-infected and suspected groups in one facility, including the treatment of common areas, playgrounds, individual cages, food, and waste management should be implemented, and each group/unit should be treated independently (care for negatives first, then positives then change clothes, etc.). <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species are sensitive to known disinfectants and regular re-disinfections. The cleaning of organic material is pivotal prior to disinfection. The removal of bacteria from outdoor spaces may be a challenge due to environmental toxicity. Therefore, an effective solution would be for each epidemiological unit to be allocated dedicated outdoor space.</p>
        <p>Kennels should keep records on the movement of animals, testing and treatment protocols and results of the testing as well as on the signs of illness, as for rabies. These records would be part of specifications to be considered when labelling the kennel as <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> free. This certification process has not yet been implemented for canine brucellosis. However, it may be a way to incentivize the kennel owners towards more regular testing and controlling dissemination of this disease.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Although known throughout the World since the 1980s, <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> started spreading in Europe only recently with the rise of canine imports from eastern Europe. <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> causes brucellosis in dogs presented primarily as a reproductive disease, expressed through the disease of reproduction, myo-skeletal and neural tissues. In humans, debilitating disease can become chronic without specific symptoms, characteristic to the infections with other highly zoonotic <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>. However, many of the pathogenic mechanisms <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> deploys are unknown. Moreover, currently sensitive and specific tools to identify <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection do not exist, and there is no consensus on diagnostic strategy nor availability of reference standards &#x2013; antigens and antibodies. Therefore, the only unequivocal evidence of infection is the strain isolation, while the negative results cannot exclude the disease. At the same time, there is no vaccine for dogs and current treatment options, combining several antibiotics with neutering, are very long, sometimes even dangerous for animal, often with lifelong relapses. Although <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> has been diagnosed in almost all European countries, no systemic epidemiological investigation has been published and there are no means to estimate current spread of the infection throughout the continent nor to evaluate the risks for public health. Furthermore, in Europe, there is no legal framework to impose neither diagnostic, nor management options for suspected and infected dogs, exacerbating the risks for further spread of the disease in dogs and for public health. This review shows that new epidemiological and experimental studies are urgently needed to elucidate some of the most important questions such as diagnostics of the <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> infection, length of infection, bacterial survival in the environment as well as different treatment options and susceptibility of bacteria to development of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, there is no diagnostic tool validated for puppies, or the test that can determine whether the infection is recent or chronic. Moreover, current control and management options are very generalized, and there are no established protocols to protect public health.</p>
