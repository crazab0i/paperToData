Sheep and goats in the vaccinated group were immunized thrice concurrently via the subcutaneous and conjunctival routes of administration at an interval of 21 days. Animals in the control group were administered with 20% Montanide Gel01 adjuvant in phosphate-buffered saline in the same way. We showed that the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine in sheep and goats induces antigen-specific Th1-biased [immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) over IgG1] antibody response and T-cell and interferon &#947; responses lasting over a period of 1 month post&#8211;last vaccination (PLV). The levels of protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M infection (vaccination efficacy) in vaccinated sheep for a period of 6 months were 0&#8211;20% and in goats 20&#8211;40% compared to control challenge group. But the severity of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M infection in the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD&#8211;vaccinated sheep and goats during the entire period of observation revealed the infection index (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.001&#8211;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization in lymph nodes and organs (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.04&#8211;<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) were significantly lower than those in the control group.

To control brucellosis in animals, vaccination is one of the most cost-effective measures, which in turn helps in protecting the health of humans in endemic areas (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This also aids in eradication of the disease among livestock (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Currently, attenuated <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1 vaccine is used in sheep and goats (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although the Rev.1 vaccine has been found effective, it has several limitations such as it causes abortion in a fraction of vaccinated animals, the vaccine bacteria are virulent to humans, and differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is a challenge (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, development of a safe and effective vaccine to control <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection in sheep and goats that has DIVA potential is warranted.</p><p>Earlier, we developed a novel <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> vaccine based on influenza viral vector (IVV) expressing <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-immunodominant outer membrane protein (Omp)16 or ribosomal L7/L12 protein (Flu-BA) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In January 2019, the Flu-BA vaccine was registered in Kazakhstan (registration certificate no. RK-VP-1-3775-19 dated January 14, 2019) and is currently being used in cattle against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> infection. The vaccine response data obtained in cattle (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), as well as information supporting the ability of influenza viruses to infect sheep and goats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), suggest that vaccines based on IVV can be an effective candidate in small ruminants. It is important to note that the IVV-expressing proteins are immunodominant and common (genetically similar for 95&#8211;99%) for <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis, B. abortus, Brucella suis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella canis</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our earlier study with Flu-BA vaccine provided 57.1 and 42.9% efficacy in vaccinated non-pregnant sheep and goats, respectively (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which prompted us to evaluate the improved Flu-BA vaccine formulation. This formulation had additional IVV-expressing <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> Omp19 and Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) proteins, an increased concentration of the adjuvant Montanide Gel01 by 2-fold called Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD, and delivery system (administered the vaccine simultaneously by subcutaneous and conjunctival routes), and the number of doses was increased to three from two and tested in pregnant sheep and goats against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> challenge infection. In pregnant small ruminants, the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine was shown to be safe and effective with complete protection (lack of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> isolation in all animal samples) against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection in 66.7% sheep and 55.6% goats (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), whereas the commercial Rev.1 vaccine provides protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection in 83.3% goats and 100% sheep (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Because of added benefits of the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine, it is considered as a promising candidate. However, it was important to define the extended duration of protective efficacy of the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD in sheep and goats, which was the objective of this study. The ability of a vaccine to form a long-term protective immune response is one of its most valuable and critical properties, and therefore this research has been decisive in continuing or discontinuing work in this area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial Strains and Biosafety Aspects</title><p>The virulent strain <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M (obtained from the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problem's collection of microorganisms) was used in this study.

All animals were non-pregnant females. Further, two groups were formed from each animal species by randomization method: the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD&#8211;vaccinated and control groups (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 15/group). Sheep and goats in the vaccinated group were immunized thrice concurrently via the subcutaneous (2.0 mL in the axillary region) and conjunctival (0.25 mL to each eye) routes of administration at an interval of 21 days with the vaccine dose 7.0 log<sub>10</sub> EID<sub>50</sub>/animal. Animals in the control group were administered with 20% Montanide Gel01 adjuvant in PBS in the same way. The antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies (total IgG, IgG2a, and IgG1), lymphocytes stimulation index (SI), and interferon &#947; (IFN-&#947;) production in animals both before and at the first (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 15/group), third (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10/group), and sixth (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5/group) months post&#8211;last (third dose) vaccination (PLV) in serum and whole-blood samples were performed.

Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight with pre-titrated mixture of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> L7/L12, Omp16, Omp19, or SOD proteins (each at 2 &#956;g/mL) in PBS, blocked for 1 h using PBS containing 1% ovalbumin (PBS-OVA; 200 &#956;L/well), and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS/Tw). Serial 2-fold dilutions of the serum samples in PBS/OVA were added (100 &#956;L/well) to the plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Donkey antiruminant IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and monoclonal antibodies specific for sheep IgG1 and IgG2 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) were used for detection of total and isotype-specific antibodies. After 90-min incubation at 37&#176;C, plates were washed, and the specific reactivity was determined by addition of an enzyme substrate ABTS [2,2_azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)] diammonium (Moss, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA) at 100 mL/well.

Earlier, we tested this vaccine's efficacy after improving the formulation (Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD) and delivery system in pregnant sheep and goats and observed promising safety and efficacy (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In this study, we for the first time evaluated the duration of protective responses in non-pregnant sheep and goats induced by the candidate vaccine. Earlier, we conducted short-term pilot studies in both non-pregnant and pregnant small ruminants. In this study, the protracted duration of effectiveness of the vaccine for up to 6 months PLV was evaluated.</p><p>The protective efficacy of the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine in non-pregnant small ruminants at the first month PLV against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection was 20% in sheep and 40% in goats, whereas in pregnant sheep and goats, it was 66.7 and 55.6%, respectively (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), wherein similar vaccine formulation and immunization regimen were followed. The severity of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection in vaccinated sheep and goats in this study was measured by infection index (3&#8211;3.4 times lower than control) and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization in tissues (lower by 131 times than control), which was inferior to those in pregnant animals (infection index 4.5&#8211;9.6, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization &gt;200 times than control) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the antigen-specific humoral and especially T-cell responses, which play an important role in the antibrucellosis immunity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), were comparable in both those studies. The Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine&#8211;induced antigen-specific IgG antibodies (IgG2a vs. IgG1), lymphocyte SI, and IFN-&#947; production in sheep and goats at the first month PLV were less (SI: 2.3&#8211;2.7 vs. 3.1&#8211;3.7; IFN-&#947; production: 15.3&#8211;16.8 vs. 19.1&#8211;19.4 ng/mL) than those in published similar pregnant small ruminant study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We partly attribute the lower protective efficacy observed in this study to a wide range in age differences (6&#8211;18 months) in experimental animals used and small numbers included in each group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5) compared to the findings in an earlier study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This assumption is consistent with previous work (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), wherein responses by PBMCs measured by two different assays between different sheep and within sheep over different sample time points varied substantially in terms of cytokine production and proliferation. In all previous experiments, animals used were more age-homogeneous, as well as in relatively larger numbers of younger animals (3&#8211;4 months, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7/group or 9&#8211;10 months, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9/group) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reliably determine the effectiveness of the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine on the adult immunized sheep and goats in this study. In any case, in this study, we used a sufficient number of animals in each group, which allowed us to obtain statistically reliable data.</p><p>At the third and sixth months PLV, we observed not only reduced Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine efficacy but also decreased humoral and T-cell responses. However, it is important to note that the severity of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M infection in vaccinated sheep and goats at the indicated time of observation, estimated by the infection index and the degree of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization from tissues, was significantly lower than in the control group. Our results demonstrated that a partial protection was induced by the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine in sheep and goats for at least 6 months PLV.</p><p>In comparison of our results on the duration of protective responses of the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine in sheep and goats with the available vaccines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), it is clear that our candidate vaccine provided that it is insufficient to provide complete protection against infection. For example, the commercial vaccine (<italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1) provides more than 80% full protection in vaccinated small ruminants for ~2&#8211;5 years (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The Flu-BA vaccine after prime-boost immunization provides at least 12 months' antigen-specific T-cell immune response and protection in 57% of cattle against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The apparent difference in the duration of the protective antibrucellosis immune response in cattle (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and small ruminants vaccinated with the same vaccine type indicates that IVV-based technology is most appropriate for cattle, and less so for sheep and goats. This can be explained by the fact that cattle are more sensitive to influenza A viruses (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and consequently, our IVVs effectively express <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> proteins and induce a more pronounced immunity. Comparative analysis of all these data with the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) indicates that it does not meet the important requirement of prolonged complete protective immunity in sheep and goats, indicating the need of improvements in the vaccine formulation, dosage, and immunization regimen. Further, it is important to note that the present study was performed using non-pregnant small ruminants, which are less sensitive to brucellosis infection (attributed to the presence of erythritol in the pregnant ruminant's placenta, an important growth factor of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and therefore expected higher vaccine efficacy than in pregnant animals, but the result was opposite. However, we still need to perform duration of protective immune responses to the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine in pregnant sheep and goats. Consistent with our vaccine results, a similar attempt to use the commercial <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine RB51 in small ruminants against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection was unsuccessful (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, the Flu-BA_Omp19-SOD vaccine using improved formulation and administration method in sheep and goats provides augmented antigen-specific humoral and T-cell immune response lasting for only 1 month PLV and partial protection for 6 months against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in compliance with national and international laws and guidelines on animal handling.
