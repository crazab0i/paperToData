Sheep and goats are the natural hosts for <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. melitensis</named-content>, and the disease manifests as spontaneous mid- to late-term abortions with infertility and retained placenta (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Humans become infected by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products, by infectious aerosols, or through direct contact with infected animals (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In humans, the disease is characterized by nonspecific flu-like symptoms of fever, malaise, anorexia, and joint pain (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Since a vaccine for use in humans is not available, vaccination of animals is an important means of preventing disease in humans (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) have been used almost exclusively to prevent brucellosis in animals because they have been proven to be the most efficacious vaccine type compared with others, such as cell extracts or DNA vaccines (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The currently approved vaccine for use in small ruminants, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Brucella melitensis</named-content> strain Rev. 1, is a live-attenuated mutant that has been extensively used worldwide since its identification (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A drawback to the use of Rev. 1 during pregnancy is a variable but significant abortion rate of 40% to 80%, which can propagate disease in the flock and poses a risk for humans handling the aborted placentas/fetuses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several attempts have been made to improve the safety of Rev. 1, such as reducing the dose or vaccination via the conjunctival mucosa, but the risk for spontaneous abortion remains (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, Rev. 1 causes a disease syndrome in humans that is similar to infection with the wild type, so it poses a risk for those administering the vaccine (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> vaccine was developed as a single mutant live-attenuated vaccine candidate and has been evaluated in BALB/c mice as well as immunodeficient mouse models to determine safety and efficacy. These studies found that 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> resulted in less inflammation and persistence than strain S19, while also protecting against challenge with wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This study expands upon previous studies in a nonpregnant mouse model, which demonstrated that 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> stimulates a protective immune response (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, given the differences in target cell specificity, studies in the mouse model alone are insufficient to determine whether the vaccine will behave safely and efficaciously in the natural host. In light of the information gained from mouse models, the next step was to determine the safety of the vaccine candidate 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> in a host that recapitulates natural infection events. Pregnant ewes, as a natural host, provide all of the appropriate tissue targets to fully evaluate the safety of the vaccine candidate during pregnancy as well as to determine whether the vaccine is capable of inducing protection against infection in nonpregnant animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s2"><title>RESULTS and DISCUSSION</title><p>The currently available vaccine for small ruminants, Rev. 1, can cause abortion in pregnant animals and disease in humans (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, an improved vaccine is needed to confer protection while failing to induce adverse events, such as abortion and vaccine shedding from animals. As a natural host and strategic target for vaccination, pregnant ewes were used to determine the safety of vaccine candidate 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> compared with Rev. 1. Pregnancy was confirmed at 60 days of gestation by ultrasonography, and ewes were then vaccinated 10 days later (day 70). Previous studies have shown that pregnant animals are most susceptible to adverse pregnancy events like abortion during midgestation (approximately 60 to 120&#8201;days of gestation) if they are exposed to wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. melitensis</named-content> or vaccinated with Rev. 1 during this time period (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, by vaccinating animals at approximately 70 days of gestation, we tried to replicate this period of increased susceptibility to abortion in pregnant ewes. The current vaccination strategy of whole-flock immunization means that pregnant animals have the potential to be vaccinated during vulnerable stages of pregnancy. Since Rev. 1 is only safe to use in young animals, an improved vaccine is critically needed that can be used for whole-flock vaccination campaigns without resulting in adverse pregnancy events that can lead to exposure of other sheep and humans.</p><sec id="s2.1"><title>Temperature.</title><p>Spontaneous abortion is often the first indication of brucellosis in a flock, but scant evidence is available to determine whether body temperature can be used in the small ruminant to predict infection or abortion potential (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In order to evaluate the temperature response to the vaccines as well as wild-type (16M) <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. melitensis</named-content>, implantable microchips were used to measure body temperature throughout the study period. The threshold for fever was established at a temperature&#8201;of &#8805;39.7&#176;C (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Similar to a previous study in goats, a transient increase in temperature was noted immediately following vaccination in all groups, which resolved by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#160;1A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Since 24 h postinoculation is insufficient to establish a systemic infection, this was considered to be a stress response to handling during vaccination. None of the animals in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> groups developed fever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#160;1D</xref>) after the initial 48-h period. Interestingly, 2 of 6 animals in the 16M and 2 of 6 ewes in the Rev. 1 groups developed transient fevers at approximately 19 to 25&#8201;days and 34 to 39&#8201;days postinoculation, respectively, during the approximate time of abortions in these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#160;1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>). A few studies have evaluated temperature following challenge with the wild type or vaccination with Rev. 1 in sheep and goats; however, these studies did not measure temperature for the whole study period and did not note fever in response to infection or vaccination (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The remaining animals in the 16M and Rev. 1 groups did not experience fever despite having spontaneous abortions, and thus, in contrast to infection in humans, fever is an unreliable indicator of systemic infection.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#160;1</label><caption><p>Body temperature in response to vaccination or infection.

As expected, 100% of the ewes administered sterile PBS had normal live births, and 100% of the ewes inoculated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. melitensis</named-content> 16M aborted between 21 to 56&#8201;days postinoculation (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>) at the anticipated time of approximately 3 to 7 weeks postinfection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additionally, 4 of 6 (67%) ewes vaccinated with Rev. 1 aborted between 18 to 44 days postinoculation (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#160;1</xref>). An abortion rate of 40% to 80% is an established side effect of Rev. 1, even when used at half (5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) or reduced doses (1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).

This holistic approach is important to evaluate the ability of a vaccine candidate to limit or prevent colonization as well as to protect against an inflammatory response in target organs. This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating vaccine candidates in natural host models because 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> provided sterile immunity combined with minimal tissue pathology in the mouse model, but information gleaned from these studies did not predict the retained virulence demonstrated in pregnant sheep (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The goal of vaccination with LAV is to decrease clinical signs and shedding rather than provide sterile immunity; therefore, 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> should be considered an improvement upon Rev. 1 due to decreased abortions and limited colonization and inflammation of tissue targets. By limiting the abortion potential, 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> reduces environmental contamination, which protects both animal and human health. However, the attenuation level of 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> may not be enough to completely reduce the risk of abortion, especially if the vaccine is given during the most susceptible stage of gestation or at extremely high doses. Dose titration or adding a second mutation could increase the attenuation of 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> and further minimize adverse side effects of vaccinating pregnant animals. In conclusion, 16M<italic toggle="yes">&#916;vjbR</italic> is a promising vaccine candidate that should be further evaluated to refine the dose and evaluate efficacy in pregnant sheep.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Bacterial strains and cultures.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">B. melitensis</named-content> biovar 1 strain 16M was originally acquired from the lung of an aborted goat (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
