As with other <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> has a tropism for the reproductive system and frequently causes abortion as well as epididymitis and prostatitis in male dogs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition to reproductive manifestations, dogs may present with lymphadenopathy, recurrent uveitis, or diskospondylitis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Alarmingly, infected dogs may present with nonspecific clinical signs or remain asymptomatic, resulting in missed diagnoses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This poses a significant health risk to other dogs as well as to humans, as silently infected dogs may continuously shed the bacteria for as long as 5.5 years, serving as an ongoing and undetected source of infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that the prevalence of canine brucellosis in the United States and other parts of the world is increasing, likely owing to a combination of the persistent nature of the pathogen, difficulties in diagnosing infected dogs, an absence of approved surveillance and prevention strategies in most countries, and most importantly, the lack of a protective vaccine (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>It has become clear over the past 50&#8201;years that control of brucellosis in any species is unachievable without vaccination (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Due to safety concerns associated with currently available live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) in domestic ruminants, such as induction of abortion in pregnant animals and residual virulence for humans, research efforts into new vaccine development have expanded into DNA and subunit preparations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In recent years, the majority of investigated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine candidates fall within this category, with fewer studies investigating LAVs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, LAVs consistently provide the greatest levels of protection in the context of brucellosis due to their ability to generate more persistent memory responses (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>To develop safer LAVs, our laboratory has generated several promising vaccine candidates through deletion of the <italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> gene, which encodes the LuxR-like quorum-sensing-related transcriptional regulator which is required for expression of the <italic toggle="yes">virB</italic> operon in both rough and smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. and is critical for survival in phagocytes and virulence in mice (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Deletion mutants generated from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Brucella abortus</named-content> S19 and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Brucella melitensis</named-content> 16M have proven to confer significant levels of protection in the mouse model and to be safe in natural swine and ruminant hosts (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Mice have become the most frequently utilized animal model for investigating candidate vaccines for brucellosis due, in large part, to substantial economic and ethical constraints associated with studies involving natural hosts, such as dogs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). While results obtained from mice are not directly transferable to humans or natural animal hosts, important information regarding safety and the potential for induction of protective cell-mediated immunity by candidate vaccines can be readily attained using the mouse model (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We recently characterized the kinetics and pathological lesions induced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> in mice and determined an appropriate challenge dose for use in future canine brucellosis vaccine studies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

While considered significantly less virulent for humans than the smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> is zoonotic and thus a public health concern (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). While numerous factors complicate the control of canine brucellosis, the lack of a protective vaccine for use in dogs is perhaps the most significant. Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) are considered to produce the highest levels of protection owing to their ability to mimic the wild-type organism in terms of cell invasion and tissue tropism (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, due to concerns for safety and risk for reversion to virulence, the majority of brucellosis vaccine research in recent years has focused on investigating killed vaccines (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Few studies into candidate vaccines for <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> have been conducted, with LAV candidates inducing superior or comparable levels of protection compared to those of killed vaccines (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this study, we chose to investigate an LAV vaccine candidate for canine brucellosis, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic>.</p><p>To be safe for use in animals, a LAV must be attenuated and persist long enough in the host to induce a lasting protective immune response. This study demonstrated that the LAV candidate, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic>, was significantly attenuated both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> in canine cells and in mice, with clearance in all organs achieved at 3 weeks postvaccination. While yet to be tested in the natural canine host, this provides evidence toward vaccine safety.</p><p>Protective efficacy was first investigated following the frequently utilized i.p. route of vaccination. While mice vaccinated with 10<sup>9</sup> CFU of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> showed significant protection against colonization, bacterial levels in the spleen at 2 weeks postchallenge remained at approximately 4 log. To improve protective efficacy, alternative strategies involving route, use of adjuvant, and booster doses were investigated. Importantly, subcutaneous vaccination resulted in comparable levels of protection. Recently, investigations into different infection routes for smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. in mice have demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> disseminates almost immediately to the spleen following both i.p. and intradermal infections, with spread from the skin largely dependent on dendritic cells (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These data and those in the present study support the advantage of the s.q. route of vaccination over the i.p. route, as it is likely to provide at least comparable protection and represents a far more feasible vaccination approach. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in protection in mice that received 1 versus 2 vaccine doses, an encouraging finding, as protection triggered by a single vaccination is the most important factor influencing the use of veterinary vaccines by marginalized populations to which canine brucellosis represents the most significant threat (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Typically, vaccine-induced protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species infection in the mouse model is restricted to evaluation of splenic colonization, with few studies investigating the liver and, even less commonly, the lung (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In this study, s.q. vaccination with <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> protected against colonization not only in the liver and spleen, known target organs for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp., but also in the lung, evidence toward a more systemic level of protection. Despite the fact that reproductive disease is a major manifestation of brucellosis and induction of abortion is a significant concern for LAVs, colonization of the uterus is rarely assessed in vaccine efficacy studies in laboratory animal models (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This is despite the fact that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. can colonize both the pregnant and nonpregnant uteri of mice and guinea pigs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Though not significant, s.q. vaccination resulted in a notable reduction in uterine colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#160;5</xref>). The significance of uterine protection in mice in the context of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> infection is uncertain, and protection in pregnant mice remains to be investigated.</p><p>Protection against colonization correlated well with protection against the development of histiocytic inflammation in the spleen and liver. In this study, vaccination with 10<sup>9</sup> CFU of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> resulted in transient splenomegaly, a gross change that is typically associated with disease in brucellosis. However, histopathologic examination revealed the presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), or production of blood cells outside the bone marrow in response to increased demand (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the absence of significant inflammatory lesions in vaccinated mice, the transient EMH likely represents a strong immune response in reaction to the vaccine. Such a change has been reported in other vaccine studies in mice, with evidence that vaccines which induce EMH result in superior levels of protection, likely by providing stores of immature immune cells primed for response upon subsequent infection (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This not only provides further support for the protective efficacy of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> but also highlights the importance of histopathology in appropriately interpreting gross changes in vaccine studies.</p><p>To begin deciphering the underlying immune mechanism of protection induced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> in mice, the humoral immune response to vaccination was investigated. It is well established that control of smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species infection is reliant on a strong TH1 immune response and, although unconfirmed, is suspected to play an important role in control of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). One component of this response is production of IgG2a antibodies which aid in opsonization of bacteria (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In this study, the groups which received either 1 or 2 subcutaneous doses of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> achieved both the greatest level of protection and significantly higher IgG2a titers than IgG1 titers. Interestingly, addition of an adjuvant Quil-A did not result in significant protection against organ colonization. Quil-A, widely used in veterinary vaccines, induces both a strong TH1 and TH2 response (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Groups which received Quil-A showed no significant differences in IgG1 versus IgG2a titers, while groups that received the vaccine alone showed a TH1-skewed response. This even balance between a TH1- and TH2-biased rather than a TH1-skewed response could explain the differences in protection.</p><p>With evidence for the ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> to protect against challenge in mice, its potential to activate immune cells in the natural canine host was investigated. Exposure of canine dendritic cells to wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 and <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> resulted in increased double expression of the activation markers, HLA-DR and CD86, as well as increased secretion of IFN-&#947;. These changes represent activation of dendritic cells, critical antigen-presenting cells involved in development of a cell-mediated immune response (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Interestingly, such activation changes were previously described in canine dendritic cells infected with wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Investigation of dendritic cell activation is an increasingly common component in vaccine studies, with evidence that enhanced dendritic cell activation may correlate with superior protection (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Activation of canine dendritic cells by <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> is intriguing, although protective efficacy in dogs remains to be investigated.</p><p>The attenuation and efficacy of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> compares well to that noted with other <italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> deletion mutants developed in our lab (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#8211;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

This discrepancy may be related to a difference in the mouse strain utilized (BALB/c versus C57BL/6) or the size of the deletion, as 753&#8201;bp of the <italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> gene was removed in our study compared to 201&#8201;bp.</p><p>This work demonstrates that the vaccine candidate <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> provides significant protection against organ colonization and histopathologic lesions in mice and induces a TH1-skewed humoral immune response. Additionally, <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> is capable of activating canine dendritic cells. We also provide evidence that the subcutaneous vaccination route provides comparable, if not superior, protection levels to those with i.p. vaccination, and this more practical method should be explored in future vaccine studies. The C57BL/6 mouse model utilizing a challenge dose of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU serves well for investigating <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> vaccine candidates, and it is critical that a standard approach in mice such as this be adopted for accurate comparison of vaccine candidates. Further studies to improve efficacy, such as the use of microencapsulation or other slow-release modalities, in addition to investigation of safety and protection in the natural canine host may be undertaken. Overall, these results suggest that <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 &#916;<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic> could serve as a safe and effective vaccine for protection against canine brucellosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Ethics statement.</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted in an approved facility in strict accordance with all university and federal regulations.

Spleens were weighed at necropsy, and the aforementioned tissues, in addition to mesenteric lymph nodes and heart, were collected at each time point and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for routine histopathologic evaluation. Tissues were routinely processed and embedded, sectioned at 4&#8201;&#956;m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections from the spleen following challenge were graded for severity of granulomatous inflammation using QuPath Bioimage analysis v. 0.1.2 (Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Foci of granulomatous inflammation were annotated, and the percentage of total tissue area affected was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4.7"><title>Measurement of humoral immune response.</title><p>Mice were bled by ventral tail vein puncture prior to the start of each experiment, at each euthanasia time point, and at biweekly intervals following s.q. vaccination. Blood was centrifuged at 3,000&#8201;rpm for 5 min, and serum was collected for anti-<named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content>-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). Briefly, 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with 250&#8201;ng/well of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. canis</named-content> RM6/66 heat-killed lysate in coating buffer (pH 9.6, 0.05 M carbonate buffer) at 4&#176;C overnight. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and nonspecific binding was blocked with 100&#8201;&#956;l of 3% skim milk in PBST at room temperature for 2 h. Following three washes, 2-fold dilutions of sera in PBST containing 1% skim milk were added and incubated at 37&#176;C for 1 h. Plates were washed five times, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Vector Laboratories), HRP-labeled rat anti-mouse IgG2a (1:2,000; Southern Biotech), or rat anti-mouse IgG1 (1:2000, clone SB77e; Southern Biotech) was added, followed by incubation at 37&#176;C for 1 h. Afterwards, OPD peroxidase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (100&#8201;&#956;l/well) and incubated for 30 min at 37&#176;C in the dark. The enzyme reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 M NaOH, and absorbance was measured at 450&#8201;nm. Endpoint titers were reported as the Log<sub>10</sub> of the highest dilution giving an OD reading higher than the mean plus 2 standard deviations of that for the baseline sera. All assays were performed in triplicates, and the results are presented as the mean reciprocal endpoint titer.</p></sec><sec id="s4.8"><title>Isolation and infection of canine dendritic cells.</title><p>Canine dendritic cells (DCs) were derived as previously described (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Briefly, 20 to 25&#8201;ml of fresh heparinized blood was obtained from healthy dogs and diluted at a 1:1 ratio in PBS followed by gentle layering onto Histopaque, density 1.077 g/ml (Sigma-Aldrich), in 50-ml conical tubes at a blood/Histopaque ratio of 2:1. Gradients were centrifuged for 40&#8201;min at 700 &#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> at room temperature with no brake. Afterwards, the interface layer consisting of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was collected and transferred to a new tube.

The cell pellet was washed twice in PBS, with the pellet finally being resuspended in separation buffer (PBS plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] plus 2&#8201;mM EDTA, pH 7.2) for magnetic bead purification. CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were isolated from the PBMCs using anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody (clone T&#220;K4) conjugated to magnetic beads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Cells were counted, resuspended in complete medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] plus <sc>l</sc>-glutamine plus 10 U/ml penicillin plus 10&#8201;&#956;g/ml streptomycin), and plated at a density of 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>5</sup> to 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 24-well plates. Culture medium was supplemented with 50&#8201;ng/ml of recombinant canine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R&amp;D Systems) and 30&#8201;ng/ml of recombinant canine interleukin 4 (IL-4) (R&amp;D Systems) to induce differentiation to DCs.

Cultures were maintained for 24 h, and cells were collected into microcentrifuge tubes by gentle pipetting and washed twice with PBSA (PBS plus 0.5% BSA). Following centrifugation, supernatants were collected and stored at &#8722;20&#176;C until further use. Afterwards, cells were incubated with 20&#8201;&#956;l of monoclonal antibodies, mouse anti-human CD86-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (clone BU63; Bio-Rad) and mouse anti-human HLA-DRII-allophycocyanin (APC) (clone G46-6; BD Biosciences), per 100-&#956;l reaction mixture of cells in PBSA for 30 min at 4&#176;C in the dark. Cells were washed twice with PBSA and resuspended in 200&#8201;&#956;l of 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature with addition of 10&#8201;&#956;l of propidium iodide. Surface marker expression was assessed via flow cytometry using an BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
