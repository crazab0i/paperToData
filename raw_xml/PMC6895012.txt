This work pursued two objectives, the first was to determine and identify the proteins in the membrane blebs by proteomics and <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis. The second aim was to evaluate the use of membrane blebs of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> 2308 and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 as an acellular vaccine <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. To achieve these aims, membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 were obtained and then analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> membrane blebs were used as a &#8220;vaccine&#8221; to induce an immune response in BALB/c mice, using the strain <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 as a positive vaccine control. After subsequent challenge with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308, CFUs in spleens were determined; and immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgG2a were measured in murine serum by ELISA. Also, activation and costimulatory molecules induced by membrane blebs were analyzed in splenocytes by flow cytometry. Two hundred and twenty eight proteins were identified in 2308 membrane blebs and 171 in RB51 blebs, some of them are well-known <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> immunogens such as SodC, Omp2b, Omp2a, Omp10, Omp16, and Omp19. Mice immunized with membrane blebs from rough or smooth <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> induced similar protective immune responses as well as the vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 after the challenge with virulent strain <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The levels of IgG2a in mice vaccinated with 2308 membrane blebs were higher than those vaccinated with RB51 membrane blebs or <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 post-boosting. Moreover, mice immunized with 2308 blebs increased the percentage of activated B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup>) <italic toggle="yes">in vitro.</italic> Therefore, membrane blebs are potential candidates for the development of an acellular vaccine against brucellosis, especially those derived from the rough strains so that serological diagnostic is not affected.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>membrane blebs</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic></kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>Gram-negative bacteria</kwd><kwd>brucellosis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="43"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The membrane blebs have been described in Gram-negative bacteria for more than 50 years (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Manning and Kuehn, 2013</xref>). These membrane blebs are released from the outer membrane of the cell to the external milieu, showing spherical shapes, and ranging in sizes from 20 to 250 nm. In general, membrane blebs are composed of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, phospholipids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as DNA and RNA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bitto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jan, 2017</xref>). Several authors have described the release of membrane blebs from different pathogens, as well as their effects <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Holst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">McConnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Stevenson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Marion et al. (2019)</xref>, showed pulmonary inflammation and neutrophil recruitment as well as cytokine production in mice inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> membrane blebs intranasally. Also, membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> induced B and T cell activation and the production of TNF&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells producing IL-8 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Membrane blebs have been involved in protein transportation including virulence factors, nutrient acquisition, horizontal genetic transfer, bactericidal action, inter-kingdom communication, and modulation of the host immune response (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jan, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Alegado, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Because of the amount of antigen present in membrane blebs and its ability to modulate the immune response, they have been tested as acellular vaccines candidates (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Membrane blebs from different pathogens such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae or Neisseria meningitidis</italic> have been used to immunize animals and then challenge them with the progenitor pathogenic bacterium to assess the efficacy of the protective immune response (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). One of the characteristics that make membrane blebs attractive to develop vaccines is that these contain natural components of the bacterial cells, so they may induce an immune response <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> but without generating infection in the host, because blebs are considering acellular entities. Membrane blebs also have shown to be good adjuvants (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). For example, blebs from <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis</italic> mixed with capsular polysaccharide from meningococcal A group were used as adjuvants to immunize rabbits, increasing the humoral immune response (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Siadat et al., 2011</xref>). Because membrane blebs both contain cellular components, such as antigenic proteins, but they are not virulent, as they aren&#8217;t the whole cell, both of these characteristics make them safer, secure and effective platform to develop acellular vaccines.</p><p>The vaccines currently used against animal brucellosis are based on live attenuated cells. The most widely used vaccines in the world to protect cattle against brucellosis are <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 19 (S19) and RB51; the first one is a smooth strain, whereas RB51 is a rough mutant (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Schurig et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2013</xref>). All commercially available vaccines including those based on <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strains are virulent for humans. Some occupational human infections have been reported, as well as infection due to raw milk consumption since vaccine strains have been shown to be excreted for short periods of time in the milk (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wallach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cossaboom et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is important to develop a safer acellular vaccine against human brucellosis.</p><p>Membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M and the rough mutant VTRM1 induced protection in mice against the challenge with virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>. The level of protection was similar to that achieved by the live vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev 1. The composition of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> membrane blebs revealed proteins involved in the immune response (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2012</xref>). Because <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> is an intracellular pathogen, it is important that the vaccine elicits a cellular immune response to provide protection. Several subunit vaccines based on purified proteins have also been tested, however, in most of the cases, these proteins provided moderate levels of protection compared with live vaccine control (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The aims of this work, were to identify the protein cargo of membrane blebs and to analyze the protective immune response induced by blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 in the murine model.

Then bacteria were harvested with a rubber policeman and suspended in 200 mL of sterile phosphate saline buffer (PBS). The bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 &#215; g for 30 min to remove intact cells. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22 &#956;m filter (Millipore Corp). Then, a sterility test was performed by culturing an aliquot of the filtered supernatant onto a TSA-YE plate followed by incubation for 96 h at 37&#176;C. The sterile supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 &#215; g for 2 h at 4&#176;C in an ultracentrifuge. The pellet obtained by ultracentrifugation was washed twice with 25 mL of sterile PBS and the membrane blebs were suspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS.

Then, 1% phosphotungstic acid was added on the samples. The grids were allowed to dry 10 h and they were observed in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL model JEM 10-10). The micrographs were taken with ATM image capture engine V. 5. 4. 2 software with different magnifications. The membrane blebs diameter was measured and the blebs were counted from ten fields with the same software. To observe membrane blebs released from the whole bacteria, cells of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 2308 and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain RB51were grown on TSA plates for 36 h at 37&#176;C, and then molten soft agar was poured to cover the growth.

These membrane blebs carry cellular components from the progenitor cell naturally; this makes them useful to induce an immunological response <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> without being infectious like the complete cell. Based on these features membrane blebs from different pathogens have been tested as an acellular vaccine in animal models and more recently they have been proposing as a target for drug delivery (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Herein for the first time, we describe the complete proteomic profile of membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> virulent strain 2308 and the vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 and tested as an acellular vaccine <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> is the etiologic agent of the bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that causes public health and economic losses issues. Previously, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Pollak et al. (2012)</xref> purified membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 2308 reporting membrane blebs ranging in sizes from 30 to 130 nm with an average of 85 nm. Later, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al. (2016)</xref> isolated membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 99 observing membrane blebs from 20 to 300 nm. In this work, the sizes of membrane blebs observed for 2308 membrane blebs were from 27.9 to 135 nm and from 27.7 to 135 nm for the strain RB51.</p><p>In the last decades, proteomics became a crucial tool to reveal the protein composition, being the 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry the most common methodology to know the content of membrane blebs (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Through proteomic analysis of membrane blebs isolated from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 were identified proteins such as SodC, Omp16, Omp19, Omp31-1, and Omp25, which have been previously reported as virulence factors or immunogenic proteins in <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Also, these proteins were part of the 112 orthologous proteins shared in membrane blebs from 2308 and RB51 strains. These proteins showed similar distribution in the subcellular location in both strains. Based on the analysis of the constituent proteins in the membrane blebs we could estimate that at least 49% of the proteins were common in both strains tested in this work. It was expected to find some similarities between both strains since the RB51 vaccine is a rough mutant derivated from the 2308 strain; RB51 strain has an <italic toggle="yes">IS711</italic> insertional sequence in the <italic toggle="yes">wboA</italic> gene (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Moriy&#243;n et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">wboA</italic> gene encodes for a glycosiltransferase, essential for the biosintesis of the O-side chain (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">McQuiston et al., 1999</xref>). Previous reports have demonstrated that O-side chain lacking in the LPS alters protein cargo of membrane blebs. For example, deletion of the galactosyltransferase gene <italic toggle="yes">wbbO</italic> of <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> leads to O-side chain lacking phenotype, this modification altered the protein composition of membrane blebs compared with membrane blebs from the wild-type, without affecting the release of blebs or the cell growth (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cahill et al., 2015</xref>). The lack of O-side chain likely affects protein packing of membrane blebs from the vaccine strain in number, type of proteins and reflects slightly different metabolic pathways enrichment likewise in <italic toggle="yes">K. pneumoniae wbbO</italic> mutant. In the case of the wildtype <italic toggle="yes">K. pneumoniae</italic>, their membrane blebs were enriched with proteins involved in the cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis, whereas vesicles purified from <italic toggle="yes">K. pneumoniae wbbO</italic> mutant contained proteins involved in the post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. In the case of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308, its membrane blebs were enriched with proteins involved in the environmental processing information, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and genetic processing information. Whereas, membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 were enriched with proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cellular process, and genetic information processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). It has been proposed that proteins bound to a negatively charged O-side chain leading to protein packing into the membrane blebs, however, in some enterobacteria, negative charge come from the core, rather than O-side chain (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Frirdich and Whitfield, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bonnington and Kuehn, 2014</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> the core oligosaccharide branch, not linked to the O-antigen, has a positive charge and balances the negative internal charges (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fontana et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest that O-side chain lacking, inbalance in their charges at the surface and this affects protein packing into the RB51 membrane blebs.</p><p>In the last decades an effort has been made to improve vaccines against brucellosis, so the research focus has been to test bacterial extracts, pure recombinant proteins, mutant strains, or DNA vaccines in animal models. Omp16, Omp19, Omp25, Omp31, and SodC have been described as immunogenic and protective antigens against brucellosis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2013</xref>). However, these proteins and others tested as vaccines have not elicited the level of the cellular response required to eliminate the intracellular bacteria, not like the one induced by a live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine. Previously, Omp19, Omp25, Omp31, and SodC were identified in <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> membrane blebs by proteomics, also these membrane blebs were able to protect mice against the challenge with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2012</xref>). The report of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> membrane blebs was the first evidence about the use of membrane blebs as a vaccine against brucellosis, which elicited a cellular protective response in mice, similar to that induced by the <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev1 live vaccine. This finding was particularly important because currently the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines are made with live cells, so the use of membrane blebs would avoid the use of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> whole cell and would be much safer. In this work, membrane blebs obtained from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 contain Omp16, Omp19, Omp25, Omp31, SodC among others identified by proteomics, as we mentioned before, these proteins were previously described as antigenic and protective proteins in <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. The results of the western blot showed that, the proteins recognized by the antibodies in the serum of immunized mice corresponded to the group 3 of outer membrane proteins of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, based on the molecular weight, probably Omp25/Omp31.</p><p>Membrane blebs from the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 were used to evaluate protection and immunological antibody response in mice. In this work we evaluated the IgG subtypes, because it is known that IFN&#947; (Th1 cytokine) and IL-4 (Th2 cytokine) induced isotype switching to IgG2a and IgG1, respectively. Therefore, different IgG isotype levels could support how the immune response is drive. This methodology has been used in other reports, being a valid assay to determine indirectly the Th1 or Th2 response (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Snapper and Paul, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Finkelman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Rostamian et al., 2017</xref>). Membrane blebs from both strains demonstrated the ability to induce protection and reduce bacterial burden at a similar level compared to the live vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, IgG antibodies were measured post-boosting and post-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). It was expected to find cross-reaction of IgG antibodies tested positive against 2308 membrane blebs and RB51 membrane blebs since the rough vaccine RB51 strain is a derivate from the virulent strain 2308. As previously mentioned, several proteins were common in membrane blebs from both strains. Mice immunized with the live vaccine and with membrane blebs from either of the strains, induced total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies against 2308 membrane blebs antigens at post-boosting, whereas the levels of antibodies against RB51 membrane blebs were more elevated after the challenge with the virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308. Mice immunized with 2308 membrane blebs induced IgG and IgG1 anti-RB51 antigens post-boosting and post-challenge, but only induced specific IgG2a antibodies after boosting. On the other hand, humoral immune response elicited by immunization with membrane blebs from the RB51 strain was almost exclusively against antigens from the same blebs and elicited high levels of IgG1 after the challenge. Clearly, 2308 membrane blebs induced better humoral response since IgG1 and the IgG2a response was elicited after the boosting and remained high post-challenge. Although IgG1 response elicited by RB51 membrane blebs immunization was higher post-challenge, it was likely due to the antibodies level induced by the challenge itself instead of vaccination, since specific IgG1 anti-RB51 membrane blebs were not observed post-boosting. Moreover, the blood sample was taken 1 week after the challenge when the infection is in the acute phase. The levels of IgG antibodies induced by 2308 membrane blebs and RB51 membrane blebs (OD values higher than 3) were higher than those reported by <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al. (2016)</xref> elicited by membrane blebs from the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 99 (OD values lower than 2). However it is important to mention that methodology followed by Kaur et al., and the one followed in this work showed substantial differences. Previously, it was observed similar and slightly high (OD values higher than 5 for IgG2a) values of antibodies in immunized mice with membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2012</xref>). Antibodies promote host defense as direct or indirect effector molecules for the immune response by complement activation or interacting with FcR receptors on the phagocytes and modulating the release of cytokines. Although it was observed a high humoral immune response in mice vaccinated with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> membrane blebs, the humoral response is not considered the most critical component of the immune response to control intracellular bacteria (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Casadevall and Pirofski, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this work, analysis of the immune response induced by membrane blebs in lymphocytes and APCs from mice spleens was performed. During the acute phase of brucellosis, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the spleen decreased and, the main antibody producing cells, the B-lymphocytes CD19<sup>+</sup>, also reside in the spleen (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Grill&#243; et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it was expected to have a decrease in cell number (at least in the lymphocytic population) in the negative control mice, which had not been vaccinated with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> membrane blebs, 2 weeks post-challenge with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308, due to the effect of challenge. We observed that the splenocytes from mice immunized with 2308 membrane blebs were able to increase the percentage of total activated cells (lymphocytes) after the treatment with 2308 or RB51 membrane blebs, while the splenocytes from mice immunized with membrane blebs of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 did not. Similar results were observed by <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al. (1994)</xref>. In this experiment, mice were inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308, RB51 and S19, and splenocytes were obtained from mice at 6, 10, and 20 weeks post-infection. Splenocytes were subsequently treated with protein fractions of a lysate of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> (22 fractions from 18 to 106 kDa) to evaluate lymphoproliferation at day 5. Authors observed lymphoproliferation in cells (from mice at 10, and 20 weeks post-infection) treated with fraction of 18 kDa, except in cells coming from mice inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 (at week 20). Based on knowing that membrane blebs are constituted of cellular components but not virulent like the whole cell, and taking into account the protection results observed in this work, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> membrane blebs position themselves as new model to research development of acellular vaccines against brucellosis.</p><p>Interestingly, stimulation of the splenocytes from immunized mice with 2308 membrane blebs or RB51 membrane blebs decreased the expression of MHC-II, being more evident in mice immunized with RB51 blebs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Pollak et al. (2012)</xref> also observed the down-regulation of MHC-II induced by IFN-&#947; in vitamin D3-differentiated THP-1 cells stimulated with membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308. Omp19 was identified in the 2308 membrane blebs and RB51 membrane blebs, this protein induces the secretion of IL-6 decreasing the transcription of the master regulator of MHC-II, thus downregulating MHC-II expression (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Vel&#225;squez et al., 2017</xref>). It is noteworthy that T cytotoxic cells percentage increased on mice immunized with membrane blebs from both strains. <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al. (2016)</xref> observed lymphoproliferation in mice immunized with membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 99S higher than the negative control group but lesser than the cells stimulated with concanavalin A (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in this work, the immunization and stimulation of splenocytes with 2308 membrane blebs increased significantly the percentage of activated B cells. Previously, membrane blebs purified from <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> VTRM1, a rough strain, induced high expression levels of Th1 cytokines genes such as IL-12, TNF&#945;, and IFN&#947; in bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#243;n et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this work, immunization with membrane blebs from both <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strains induced protective immune response against virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> challenge. Likely, the protective immune response elicited by <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> membrane blebs immunization rely on the action of professional phagocytes such as macrophages or neutrohils rather than APCs. Clearly, immunization with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 membrane blebs induced cellular and humoral immune response, since stimulation of the splenocytes induced increased levels of T and B cells expressing CD69 and strong IgG2a immune response after the boost. However, we propose the use of membrane blebs from the live vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51: (i) first, immunization with RB51 membrane blebs induced 1.33 log units of protection more than the whole live vaccine strain which is approved for their use in animals; (ii) the membrane blebs, from a rough strains like the RB51 strains do not induce antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-LPS, therefore, do no interfere with the serological diagnostic; (iii) although 2308 membrane blebs induced strong IgG response, this could be detrimental in chronic brucellosis phase. In fact, infection with smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains induced high titers of antibodies against LPS, whereas immunization of cattle with RB51 vaccine induced IgG antibodies but not against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308-LPS (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Stevens and Olsen, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Letesson et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion: Membrane blebs from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 and RB51 induced protection similarly than the live vaccine <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 in mice, membrane blebs offer the advantage of being non-virulent as live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines and contain antigenic and cellular components able to induce protective response.
