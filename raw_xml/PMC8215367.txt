<italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe economic loss to husbandry and poses a threat to human health. The <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19 live vaccine has been extensively used to prevent bovine brucellosis in China. However, it is difficult to distinguish the serological response induced by A19 from that induced by natural infection. In this study, a novel genetically marked vaccine, A19&#916;virB12, was generated and evaluated. The results indicated that A19&#916;virB12 was able to provide effective protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 (S2308) challenge in mice. Furthermore, the safety and protective&#160;efficacy of A19&#916;virB12 have been confirmed in natural host cattle. Additionally, the VirB12 protein allowed for serological differentiation between the S2308 challenge/natural infection and A19&#916;virB12 vaccination. However, previous studies have found that the accuracy of the serological detection based on VirB12 needs to be improved. Therefore, we attempted to identify potential supplementary antigens with differential diagnostic functions by combining label-free quantitative proteomics and protein chip technology. Twenty-six proteins identified only in S2308 were screened; among them, five proteins were considered as potential supplementary antigens. Thus, the accuracy of the differential diagnosis between A19&#916;virB12 immunization and field infection may be improved through multi-antigen detection. In addition, we explored the possible attenuation factors of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine strain. Nine virulence factors were downregulated in A19&#916;virB12. The downregulation pathways of A19&#916;virB12 were significantly enriched in quorum sensing, ATP-binding cassette transporter, and metabolism. Several proteins related to cell division were significantly downregulated, while some proteins involved in transcription were upregulated in S2308. In conclusion, our results&#160;contribute to the control and eradication of brucellosis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of A19&#916;virB12.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>protein chip technology</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic></kwd><kwd>A19&#916;virB12</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>differential diagnosis</kwd><kwd>attenuation mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="76"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="7330"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brucellosis is an important reemerging zoonosis that causes tremendous economic losses in animal husbandry and presents a significant risk to public health. The pathogen of brucellosis is <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, a small gram-negative coccobacillus lacking spores. Several <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species have been found to be pathogenic to humans, including <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and B. canis</italic>. Transmission can occur through direct contact with body fluids of infected animals, ingestion of contaminated dairy products, and aerosol (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In the absence of an effective vaccine protecting humans from <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, the research and development of animal vaccines will be beneficial to both animals and humans (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 strain A19 vaccine has been widely employed in China and offers a high level of protection for cattle. However, the antibody response induced by the O-side chain of the A19 vaccine interferes with serological diagnosis, which hardly distinguishes between vaccinated and infected animals (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Undoubtedly, this shortcoming of traditional vaccines impairs efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases. Fortunately, the development and application of gene-deleted vaccines can overcome this limitation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is well known that the use of gene-deleted vaccines, such as gE-null marker strains, has led to great progress in the eradication of Pseudorabies virus in some areas (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we generated the genetically marked vaccine A19&#916;virB12 by knocking out <italic toggle="yes">virB12</italic> gene in this study. The VirB12 protein, a component of the type IV secretion system (T4SS), has been shown to be a potential marker for the serological diagnosis of brucellosis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The results indicated that A19&#916;virB12 has similar virulence to that of its parent strain in mice. Immunization of mice with A19&#916;virB12 conferred protection against challenge with the virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 (S2308). Furthermore, the safety and protective efficacy of A19&#916;virB12 were confirmed in cattle. VirB12-based iELISA can differentiate the vaccination from S2308 challenge/natural infections. However, previous studies have shown that the sensitivity and specificity of serological detection based on VirB12 needs to be improved (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this regard, new antigens should be identified and combined with VirB12 to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis. Proteomics has become an indispensable tool for comparing the differences of protein expression profiles between virulent and attenuated strains (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Moreover, protein microarrays are an effective method for discovering antigen-specific antibody responses and identifying novel antigens. The two methods were combined in this study to screen for supplementary differential diagnosis antigens. In addition, based on the difference of proteomics between A19&#916;virB12 and S2308, we explored factors that may lead to significant differences in virulence between wild-type and vaccine strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>BALB/c female mice (age, 7 weeks) were acquired from Tecon Biological Co., Ltd.

Three weeks after virulent challenge, all mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation, and the spleens were collected and weighed. In addition, the levels of gamma interferon (IFN-&#947;) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in mice serum were determined at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 wpv and 3 weeks post-challenge(wpc) using the mouse IL-4 ELISA kit and the IFN-&#947; ELISA kit, according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (Cloud-Clone, Corp., USA).

<bold>Table S6</bold>
</xref>. These proteins are located on the cytoplasmic membrane (10 proteins) or cytoplasm (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Notably, three of them were T4SS proteins, including VirB4 (<italic toggle="yes">virB4</italic>), VirB9 (<italic toggle="yes">virB9</italic>), and VirB11 (<italic toggle="yes">virB11</italic>). We speculate that the absence of VirB12 may implicate the expression of other T4SS proteins.

<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> infection causes rapid activation of innate immunity, including phagocytosis by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. The activation of pattern recognition receptors by pathogen-associated pattern molecules and the secretion of cytokines are key factors in the elimination of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella (</italic>
<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). IFN-&#947; is required for resistance to brucellosis and is closely related to the elimination of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. On the contrary, IL-4 antagonizes IFN-&#947; mediated antibacterial activity, and promotes chronic infection. This may be due to the interaction between host and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella (</italic>
<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection has caused great economic losses, affecting many livestock, wildlife and human. Vaccine immunization is still a necessary strategy for the prevention and control of brucellosis. The licensed <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines are live attenuated vaccines, which retain the invasion process similar to that of the wild-type strains, but are easier to be eliminated by the immune system and can induce the production of efficient humoral and cellular immune responses in immunized animals (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). However, these vaccines have obvious limitations in the control and eradication of brucellosis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). At present, the development of gene-deleted vaccines&#160;allows for serological differential&#160;diagnosis between vaccination and field infections (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Here, the <italic toggle="yes">virB12</italic> mutant was derived from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308 strain A19. Firstly, the deletion of <italic toggle="yes">virB12</italic> gene did not affect the replication ability of A19 within the mice. In addition, vaccination with A19&#916;virB12 could elicit obvious cellular immune response and provide good protection efficacy against a challenge with S2308 in mice. A19&#916;virB12 vaccinated mice induce&#160;production&#160;of IFN-&#947; and IL-4. However, low levels&#160;of IL-4 were induced in mice vaccinated with another commonly used vaccine, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>&#160;RB51, indicating that different vaccine strains cause different protective mechanism. Furthermore, the safety and protection efficiency of A19&#916;virB12 were confirmed in natural host cattle. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in cows and ewes is a public health issue and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>&#160;has become the dominant species&#160;in China. Although goats and sheep are the preferential host for <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, this pathogen has become a cause&#160;for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> outbreaks in cattle (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our results showed that vaccination with A19&#916;virB12 can confer effective protection in cattle against the challenge with&#160;<italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> M28 and is safe for pregnant cattle. What&#8217;s more, VirB12 allowed for the serological differentiation between S2308 challenge/natural infection and A19&#916;virB12 vaccination. Recently, A19&#916;virB12 was approved and became the first brucellosis genetically marked vaccine in China (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>However, the sensitivity and specificity of differential diagnosis based on a single protein need to be improved. We believe that detection of multiple antigens may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis. Therefore, we attempted to identify novel antigens that could induce differential responses to A19&#916;virB12 vaccination and natural infection. Using a proteomics approach, the protein expression profiles of S2308 and A19&#916;virB12 were compared, and 26 proteins were identified only in S2308. Currently, most proteomics studies focus on differential regulatory proteins. In this study, we focused on the proteins only expressed in the virulent strain, which may have the potential for differential diagnosis. Protein-chip technology was used to further confirm the immune response of these proteins; the IgG response level of challenged sera against five proteins was higher than that of immunized sera in cattle. This suggests that A19&#916;virB12 immunization and field infection may be more accurately distinguished by detecting multiple antigens. Differential vaccines combined with companion diagnostic methods facilitate the control and eradication of epidemic diseases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Future research should focus on the development of corresponding diagnostic approaches. In general, we innovatively combined the proteomics approach&#160;with the protein array technology in this study, which provides a reference strategy for screening target proteins for the differential diagnosis of other pathogens.</p><p>In addition, virulence attenuation mechanisms of vaccine strains are the focus of many studies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). There was no significant difference at the genomic level between the S2308 and A19 vaccine strains (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Therefore, proteomics studies may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms causing great differences in virulence between the virulent and attenuated strains. In this study, potential attenuation mechanisms of A19&#916;virB12 were analyzed as follows.</p><p>First, some downregulated virulence factors in A19&#916;virB12 were identified (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#160;2</bold>
</xref>). VjbR protein (<italic toggle="yes">vjbR</italic>), a member of the LuxR-type QS regulators, was induced in both the logarithmic and stationary phase of S2308. Previous studies have shown that VjbR is involved in regulating the expression of virulence factors during the early stage of intracellular infection (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Urease, another factor associated with the survival of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> was also affected. In the process of gastrointestinal tract infection, the presence of urease, a nickel-binding protein, enhances the survival capability of pathogenic microorganisms in acidic environments, including <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> contains two urease operons, ure1 and ure2, and the latter contains the genes of ure ABCEFGDT involved in the transport of urea and nickel (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In this study, ureC2 and ureG2, contained in the ure2 operon, were more abundant at the protein level in the logarithmic phase of S2308, while ureC2 and ureA2 were found to be induced in the stationary phase of S2308 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In addition, several virulence gene products were upregulated in the logarithmic phase of S2308, including <italic toggle="yes">cydB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">bacA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">recA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">pgm</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">leuA</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cydB</italic> is responsible for encoding cytochrome bd oxidase. The absence of <italic toggle="yes">cydB</italic> increases the sensitivity of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to environmental stresses and affects its intracellular survival (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Similarly, the bacteroid development protein BacA(<italic toggle="yes">bacA</italic>) is required for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to establish chronic infection in mice (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Intracellular pathogens inevitably encounter a series of adverse conditions during their life cycle. Timely repair of DNA damage is particularly vital for the intracellular survival of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). RecA protein (<italic toggle="yes">recA</italic>) is an important protein involved in DNA repair pathways. There is no doubt that the lack of RecA reduces the ability of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to deal with DNA damage (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">pgm</italic> is responsible for the production of phosphoglucomutase, catalyzing the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate. Mutation of <italic toggle="yes">pgm</italic> that is related to the loss of O-antigen generates a rough phenotype that is usually less virulent (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Another metabolic enzyme considered to be a virulence factor of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> was 2-isopropylmalate synthase (<italic toggle="yes">leuA</italic>), which is essential for the survival of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> within macrophages (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>The QS pathway was found to be enriched significantly in the logarithmic phase of S2308 compared with that of A19&#916;virB12 (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#160;3</bold>
</xref>). QS is a cell-cell communication system involved in monitoring bacterial populations. First, bacteria produce small extracellular signaling molecules that accumulate gradually as the number of bacteria increases. When the concentration of signaling molecules reaches the threshold of detection limit, bacteria respond and synchronously regulate the expression of many genes. QS systems are involved in multiple bacterial processes that are beneficial for survival, such as biofilm formation, virulence factor secretion, and bioluminescence production (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In view of the role of the QS system in the regulation of virulence factors, it has become a new therapeutic target for some bacterial diseases (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The significant enrichment of the QS pathway in S2308 may be one of the main reasons for the significant differences in virulence and intracellular survival between the marked vaccine strain and the virulent strain.</p><p>In addition, some proteins identified as being downregulated were associated with ABC transporters in the logarithmic phase of A19&#916;virB12 (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#160;3</bold>
</xref>). ABC transporters, a large group of membrane protein complexes, are responsible for transmembrane transport of multiple nutrients, accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that ABC transporters are related to virulence in some bacteria by transporting various nutrients and metal ions as well as promoting adhesion (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Additionally, a previous study has indicated that the absence of an ABC transporter leads to increased susceptibility of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> to polymyxin B (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In this work, the upregulated ABC transporters were mainly involved in the uptake of amino acids, especially BCAA (valine, leucine, and isoleucine). Amino acids not only provide energy for protein synthesis, but are also precursors of many important metabolites, such as ammonia, ketone bodies, and glucose (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Moreover, BCAA uptake is closely related to the pathogenicity of pathogenic bacteria (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Some intracellular pathogens rely on BCAA transport proteins to support their growth within host cells (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Thus, decreased BCAA utilization may lead to lower virulence in A19&#916;virB12.</p><p>This group of proteins was associated with cell division. Interestingly, some key proteins participating in cell division were observed to be more abundant in A19&#916;virB12 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF2">
<bold>Figure S2</bold>
</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST4">
<bold>Table S4</bold>
</xref>). Cell division is a complex process that requires the participation and coordination of a large number of proteins. The cell division protein ZapA is involved in the formation of a septum called Z-ring in the middle of the cell (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Min proteins (MinE, MinC, and MinD) play a role in the right placement of Z-ring for equal cell distribution (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). The cytoplasmic ATPase FtsE is involved in promoting septal ring constriction. The cell division coordinator CpoB is required for the coordination of peptidoglycan synthesis and outer membrane constriction (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Tyrosine recombinase XerD facilitates the disaggregation of chromosome dimers (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). In the logarithmic phase, ZapA, XerD, and CpoB were downregulated in S2308 compared with A19&#916;virB12 at the protein level. In addition, decreased expression levels of MinE and FtsE were observed in the stationary phase of S2308. We assumed that A19&#916;virB12 may have a higher growth rate. Indeed, higher growth rate leads to more material consumption. Especially in the stationary growth period, accompanied by resource depletion and increased levels of toxic metabolites, limiting reproduction level is a wise choice. Notably, in the early stage of the intracellular life cycle, growth arrest was observed in S2308 within the endosomal <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-containing vacuole (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Thus, it may be an important survival strategy for S2308 to limit the level of cell reproduction when necessary.</p><p>Based on the COG analysis, 13 and 7 upregulated proteins related to transcription were found in the logarithmic and stationary phase of S2308, respectively. Most of them were bacterial regulatory proteins belonging to different families, such as ArsR, AsnC, and MerR families. Within the group of transcriptional regulators, one protein with &#963;70 factor activity was induced in S2308 during the logarithmic phase. &#963; factors are required for initiation of transcription at promoters, and most &#963; factors belong to the &#963;70-family. The existence of &#963; factor is important for bacteria to sense and respond to environmental changes in time (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Thus, active transcriptional regulation, timely response, and adaptation to environmental changes may be key factors in the pathogenicity of virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, A19&#916;virB12 was successfully generated. The safety and protective efficacy of A19&#916;virB12 have been confirmed in mice and cattle. VirB12 protein has potential as a diagnostic antigen for the differentiation of A19&#916;virB12-immunization from field infection. We screened for supplementary antigens by combining proteomics and protein chip technology to optimize the accuracy of the differential diagnosis of the VirB12-based method. Among the 26 proteins identified only in S2308, five proteins induced a higher IgG response to challenged sera than immune sera. In addition, we analyzed virulence-related proteins and pathways between S2308 and A19&#916;virB12. The upregulation of virulence factors and QS system, active intake of nutrients, control of reproduction, timely response to environmental change, and induction of virulence factors may mediate the high pathogenicity of S2308. In other words, the difference in virulence is caused by multiple factors. The exploration of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> virulence will provide some potential targets for the treatment of brucellosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
