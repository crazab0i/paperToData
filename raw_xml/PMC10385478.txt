      <abstract>
        <p>Background: <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> is the main causative agent for bovine brucellosis. <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19 is a widely used vaccine strain to protect cows from <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in China. However, A19 has a similar lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen to that of the field virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strain, whose immunization interferes with the serodiagnosis of vaccinated and infected animals. [Aim] To develop a novel <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> DIVA vaccine candidate. Study design and methods: The <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> mutant A19mut2 with the formyltransferase gene <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> is replaced by an acetyltransferase gene <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 using the bacterial homologous recombination technique, generating a modified O-polysaccharide that cannot induce antibodies in mice against wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> LPS. The biological phenotypes of the A19mut2 were assessed using a growth curve analysis, agglutination tests, Western blotting, and stress resistance assays. Histopathological changes and bacterial colonization in the spleens of vaccinated mice were investigated to assess the residual virulence and protection of the A19mut2. Humoral and cellular immunity was evaluated by measuring the levels of IgG, IgG subtypes, and the release of cytokines IFN-&#x3B3; and IL10 in the splenocytes of the vaccinated mice. ELISA coated with wild-type LPS can distinguish mouse antibodies induced by A19 and A19mut2 immunization. Results: The A19mut2 showed a decreased residual virulence in mice, compared to the A19 strain, but induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses, as the A19 immunization did. The protection efficacy of A19mut2 immunization against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S2308 Nal<sup>R</sup> infection was similar to that of A19 immunization. Conclusion: The A19mut2 has potential as a novel DIVA vaccine candidate in the future.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is an important recurrent zoonosis that causes significant economic losses, including in terms of livestock, and poses a substantial public health risk. Brucellosis is caused by a pathogen known as <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, which lacks spores and is a Gram-negative coccobacillus. To decrease these high economic losses, the production of an effective veterinary vaccine would be an effective strategy to control <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in humans and animals [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Vaccination is now the most cost-effective method of preventing and controlling brucellosis. In China, the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine A19 has been used extensively to protect cattle, but the antibody response, especially induced by the O-polysaccharide (O-PS) of LPS, hinders serological diagnoses, including serum agglutination tests, Rose Bengal plate tests, complement fixation tests, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs); thus, it is difficult to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is no doubt that the limitation of the A19 vaccine significantly affects ongoing efforts to eliminate and control brucellosis. However, the use and development of gene-deleted vaccines could be an effective strategy to overcome the interference with serological diagnoses [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, a <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev1 vaccine strain with the deletion of the formyltransferase gene <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> associated with O-PS synthesis and tagged with acetyltransferase <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> elicited antibodies that could be distinguished from those evoked by wild-type strains, was relatively attenuated, and provided protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic> [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This ingenious strategy could effectively solve the shortcomings of residual virulence and the differential diagnosis of vaccines. However, related strategies have not been used and evaluated for <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccines, which motivated us to conduct relevant studies in <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine strain A19.</p>
      <p>In this study, the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene in <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19 was replaced by the <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157, generating an O-PS-modified mutant strain, A19mut2. Our findings suggest that the A19mut2 exhibits potential as a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated individuals) vaccine candidate against brucellosis.</p>

        <title>2.2. Brucella Strains and Cultural Conditions</title>
        <p><italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine strain A19 and wild-type strain S2308 were obtained from the Chinese Veterinary Culture Collection Center (CVCC, Beijing, China). <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> nalidixic acid-resistant strain 2308 Nal<sup>R</sup> was derived from the S2308 by induction of nalidixic acid [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The S2308 strain was used to prepare the heat-killed antigens. The S2308 Nal<sup>R</sup> strain was used as a challenge to determine the protection of vaccination. <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> rough-type strain RB14 (<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 2308 with deletion of <italic toggle="yes">rfbE</italic> gene) was constructed in our previous study [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB, Difco, NJ, USA) or tryptic soy agar (TSA) at 37 &#xB0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Experiments dealing with live <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strains were all performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory facility at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strain O157 (passaged and stocked in our lab) and DH5&#x3B1; (TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium. When appropriate, 50 &#x3BC;g/mL of kanamycin or 15 &#x3BC;g/mL of nalidixic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) were added.

        <p>A suicide plasmid was constructed as previously described with modifications [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, a 2795 bp fragment, including <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene and its upstream and downstream fragments, was amplified by PCR from the genome of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19 strain using primers WbkC-F and WbkC-R. The fragment was cloned into PCR-linearized pKB plasmid using a seamless cloning and assembly kit (ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit, Vazyme, Nanjing, China), and then the recombinant plasmid was further linearized by inverse PCR using primers rWbkC-F and rWbkC-R to exclude the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene containing its promoter region was amplified from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 by PCR using primers WbdR-F and WbdR-R. The recovered <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> fragment was cloned into inverse PCR-linearized recombinant plasmid to replace <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene using the seamless cloning and assembly kit as described above. The suicide plasmid pKB-&#x394;wbkC::wbdR was propagated in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> DH5&#x3B1; cells and used to construct the mutant. A19mut2 mutant was constructed by allelic replacement using a two-step strategy as previously described [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>

        <p>Virulence test was performed as described previously [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The OD<sub>600</sub> value of bacterial cultures was adjusted to 1.0 (5 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL). Bacterial suspension was serially diluted 10-fold to 5 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL.

At 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-weeks post inoculation (WPI), five mice from each group were sacrificed, and their spleens were aseptically removed and homogenized in PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions of spleen homogenates were plated on TSA plates and incubated for 3&#x2013;5 days at 37 &#xB0;C. The CFUs were enumerated to evaluate colonization efficiency of each strain in mice.

        <title>3.1. A19-Derived Mutant A19mut2 Was Constructed Successfully with an Antigenically Modified O-PS</title>
        <p>A19mut2 was derived from <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine strain A19, in which the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene was replaced by the <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157 using the method of gene homologous recombination (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Firstly, we verified the A19mut2 by PCR assay, showing that the fragment of the <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene in A19mut2 was amplified using the cross primers ID-F1 and ID-R1, but not in A19 (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). When the fragment of the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene was amplified by PCR using the cross primers ID-F1 and ID-R2, the target band was shown in the control strain A19, but not in the A19mut2 strain (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The result revealed that in the A19mut2 strain, the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene was successfully replaced by the <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene. Secondly, the growth curve of A19mut2 was compared with that of A19, showing no significant difference (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). Then we analyzed the smooth phenotype of A19mut2 using acridine yellow agglutination and heat agglutination tests. The results showed that the A19mut2 did not agglutinate with 1% acridine orange or with heat incubation for 2 h (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D,E), which was similar to the behavior of the A19 strain. The rough-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> control strain RB14 showed significant agglutination when treatedwith acridine yellow or heat (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D,E). The results revealed that A19mut2 is a smooth-type strain. Finally, to further confirm that A19mut2 expressed a modified O-PS that was distant from that of the original strain, A19, LPS silver staining and Western blotting were performed for verification. The LPS staining showed that both strains exhibited an integral LPS structure, but the migration profile of O-PS from A19mut2 was different from that of the A19 strain, displaying a shortened O-PS (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). Additionally, Western blotting was carried out to evaluate the antigenicity of O-PS from A19mut2 using polyclonal antibodies against smooth <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and monoclonal antibodies specifically against O-PS, showing that the LPS from A19mut2 had no reaction with the polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but the LPS from the A19 strain had an obvious reaction with both antibodies (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). These data suggested that the A19mut2 was successfully constructed with a smooth phenotype and showed an antigenically modified O-PS compared to that of the original strain, A19.</p>

        <title>3.2. A19mut2 Reduced Its Ability to Resist Acidic pH, but Not Hydrogen Peroxide, Polymyxin B, and Sodium Nitroprusside (SNP)</title>
        <p>To assess the ability of A19mut2 to resist bactericidal factors, hydrogen peroxide, SNP, polymyxin B, and an acidic buffer were used to evaluate its sensitivity compared to that of the A19 strain. As shown in <xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B, A19mut2 showed similar sensitivity to the hydrogen peroxide and polymyxin B. In the SNP test, A19mut2 also exhibited a similar sensitivity to SNP relative to A19 (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). These data suggested that the O-PS modification did not affect <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>&#x2019;s ability to resist killing by oxidative stress, cationic bactericidal peptides, and nitrosative stress. However, when incubated in a different acidic peptone buffer, A19mut2 had a significantly reduced survival rate at pHs of 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5 compared to that of the A19 strain (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), suggesting that O-PS modification affects <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>&#x2019;s capacity to tolerate acid shock.</p>

        <title>3.3. A19mut2 Showed Similar Residual Virulence Compared to the A19 Strain</title>
        <p>To assess the residual virulence of A19mut2, BALB/c mice were inoculated by A19mut2 or A19 with a dose of 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mouse. The number of CFUs in the spleen was determined at 2, 4, 6, and 8 WPI. The results showed that the CFU of the A19mut2 recovered from the spleen was significantly reduced in comparison with that of the A19 strain at 2 WPI (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, although the bacterial loads recovered from the spleen inoculated by A19mut2 at 4 and 6 WPI were slightly higher than that of the A19 strain, no significant difference was found in both strains&#x2019; vaccinated groups. At 8 WPI, the A19mut2 showed a similar level of spleen colonization as the A19 strain (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further evaluate the residual virulence of the A19mut2 strain, a histopathological examination via hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed in the spleens and livers inoculated by the A19mut2 and A19 strains. PBS inoculations were carried out as the negative control. The histopathology of the spleens vaccinated by A19mut2 showed the necrosis of white pulps and hyperplasia of connective tissues at 2 or 4 WPI, which were restored to the normal morphology at 6 and 8 WPI. The A19-inoculated spleen only showed obvious histopathological changes at 2 WPI, but not at 4, 6, or 8 WPI (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, left panel). The livers vaccinated by the A19mut2 and A19 strains showed visible granuloma at 2, 4, and 6 WPI and were restored to the normal morphology at 8 WPI with no obvious difference (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, right panel). Meanwhile, the PBS-inoculated spleens and livers showed no histopathological changes at all indicated times (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, right panel). The data suggest that the residual virulence of A19mut2 is basically equivalent to that of the A19 strain.</p>

        <title>3.4. A19mut2 Induced Humoral- and Cellular-Mediated Immune Response</title>
        <p>Sera were collected from the immunized mice at 2, 4, 6, and 8 WPI and assessed for the presence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-specific antibodies IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a based on the ELISA coated by the total <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> S2308 lysates. The ELISA results showed that A19 induced significant levels of antibodies IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in the mice compared to the PBS group (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). However, A19mut2 only induced significant levels of lgG and IgG2a in the mice at 6 and 8 WPI, but not at 2 and 4 WPI in comparison with the PBS group. Moreoever, the IgG1 level in the mice was not induced by A19mut2 in any of the phases of vaccination. Furthermore, when compared to the A19 vaccination, A19mut2 induced decreased levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in the mice (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggested that LPS is an important component in <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to induce antibody production, as previously reported in the literature [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the levels of antibodies were reduced in the A19mut2-vaccinated mice, the lgG2a levels were predominant in their immune responses, suggesting a bias towards to a Th1-type response.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the cellular immune response, the supernatants were collected from the stimulated splenocytes of the mice at 6 WPI, and the Th1-type cytokine IFN-&#x3B3; and the Th2-type cytokine IL-10 were assessed using an ELISA kit. As shown in <xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, when the splenocytes were stimulated by heat-killed S2308, the splenocytes from the A19- and A19mut2-immunized mice produced significant amounts of IFN-&#x3B3; and IL-10 in comparison with that of the PBS-inoculated mice, and no significance was found between the A19 and A19mut2 groups in terms of cytokine production. The splenocytes in the RPMI1640 incubation produced low amounts of cytokines in all the tested groups. These data suggested that A19mut2 induced similar humoral and cellular immune responses with a predominately Th1-type response to the A19 strain.</p>

When the immunized mice were challenged by a wild-type S2308 Nal<sup>R</sup> strain, both strains offered significant protection compared to that of the PBS-dosed mice and a significant decrease in the bacterial load in the spleens relative to that in the PBS-dosed mice, with a 1.19-log and 0.81-log reduction for A19 and A19mut2, respectively (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Although the bacterial loads in the spleens of the A19mut2-immunized mice were a little higher than those of the A19 immunization, there were no significant differences in the bacterial loads between the A19- and A19mut2-immunized mice (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These results indicated that the A19mut2 vaccination confers a similar protective efficacy in comparison with the A19 vaccination in mice.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>The O-PS of smooth-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> LPS is an unbranched homopolymer of N-formyl-perosamine (4-formanido-4,6-dideoxy D-mannose) in various proportions of &#x3B1;-(1-2)- and &#x3B1;-(1-3)-linkages [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is exposed to the surface of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to form the main epitopes in serological diagnoses. The genetic modification of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> O-PS could open the possibility of solving the diagnostic interference induced by current <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines. In previous literature, Estrella M. et al. introduced an O-PS acetyltransferase WbdR from <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> O157:H7 into <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to replace its O-PS formyltransferase WbkC, generating a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> mutant with an O-PS modification carrying N-acetyl-perosamine [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This ingenious strategy offers an effective solution to the current issue of serological differential diagnoses between vaccine immunization and wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. In this study, the <italic toggle="yes">wbdR</italic> gene was inserted into the genome of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine strain A19 to replace the <italic toggle="yes">wbkC</italic> gene, producing a <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine mutant, A19mut2. As anticipated, A19mut2 exhibited a modified and shortened O-PS in comparison to that of the original O-PS, which was consistent with the previous <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> construct, Rev 1::Tn7wbdR&#x394;wbkC [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, in a previous study, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus wbdR</italic> constructs (Ba::Tn7wbdR and Ba::Tn7wbdR&#x394;wbkC) exhibited a more sensitivity to bovine serum, but not to bactericidal polycations, such as polymyxin B [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we showed that the sensitivity of the A19mut2 to polymyxin B remained unchanged compared to that of the A19 strain, which was in line with that of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus wbdR</italic> constructs [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, our study revealed that A19mut2 exhibited a greater sensitivity to low pHs compared to that of the A19 strain. It is well known that lysosomal acidification is required for the activation of the type IV secretion system and the subsequent intracellular survival of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although we did not find that A19mut2 reduced its intracellular survival within the RAW264 cells, different cells should be further evaluated, especially primary macrophages. Anyway, these data let us assume that the modified O-PS decreased the resistance of the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> to acidic environments or perhaps the resistance to natural serum, which may account for the attenuated virulence of A19mut2 in the early immune stage.</p>
      <p>The protection by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines is mediated by the induction of humoral- and cellular-mediated immunity. In this study, the humoral and cellular immune responses induced by the A19mut2 strain were characterized by analyzing the antibody response and the cytokines released in the splenocytes induced by the immunogen, respectively. In the humoral immune response, although A19mut2 can induce higher levels of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-specific IgG antibodies than in unvaccinated mice, the levels were significantly lower than those of the A19 induction. This reduction is most likely due to the O-PS modification; A19mut2 lost the ability to induce antibodies against the original LPS. Moreoever, the levels of specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in serum suggested that the A19mut2 induced a Th1- and Th2-type mixed immunity and found that IgG2a predominated in the A19mut2-immunized mice, suggesting that their immunity was biased towards a Th1-type response. This result was similar to that previously reported for <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> BA15&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">cydC</italic>&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">cydD</italic> and BA15&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">cydC</italic>&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">purD</italic> mutants [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In terms of cellular immunity, the levels of cytokine secretion in the splenocytes induced by the A19mut2 strain were similar to those of the A19 strain. Meanwhile, it was shown that the Th1-type cytokine IFN-&#x3B3; was more prominently secreted than the Th1-type cytokine IL-10. All these data suggested that vaccination with A19mut2 favors a Th1-biased humoral- and cellular-mediated immune response. A similar result was also found in other vaccine strains, such as <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> IVK15<italic toggle="yes">&#x394;cydD</italic> and IVK15&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">cydC</italic> mutants [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 2308&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">nodV</italic>&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">nodW</italic> double mutant [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Th1-biased immune response is deemed to play a major role in the establishment of a protective response against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
      <p>The protection rate of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> live vaccines is usually expressed by the reduction in the bacterial loads in the spleens of immunized mice via the wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> challenges. Although the protection of A19mut2 was similar to that of the A19 strain with no significant difference, the bacterial loads in the mice&#x2019;s spleens were higher in the A19mut2-vaccinated mice after the virulence challenge than those in the mice with the A19 vaccination. Interestingly, this phenomenon was also found in Rev1 wbdR tag vaccine Rev1::Tn7wbdR&#x394;wbkC immunization against <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic> [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When a higher dose is used in the inoculation, the vaccine can confer a similar protection to the Rev1 at the standard dose. It is worth noting that the property of autoagglutination suggests surface similarities between the Rev1::Tn7wbdR&#x394;wbkC construct and rough-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, we found that A19mut2 did not show an autoagglutination property like that of the rough-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella,</italic> as shown above (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), which had properties biased towards smooth strains. Moreover, Rev1::Tn7wbdR&#x394;wbkC displayed a reduced virulence compared to that of the Rev1 strain, but A19mut2 did not show a significant reduction in virulence relative to that of the A19 strain, especially in the late stage (<xref rid="vaccines-11-01273-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It can be concluded that the modification of O-PS in different <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. may present different biological characteristics. Moreover, the antibodies anti-O-PS produced in the immunized mice may also confer protection against smooth-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, which can be concluded from the mice that were partially protected by inoculation with monoclonal antibodies against LPS [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The N-acetyl-perosamine O-PS in A19mut2 cannot induce mice to produce the antibodies against the original O-PS (N-formyl-perosamine), which may explain the slight reduction in protection relative to that of the A19 strain.</p>
      <p>The great advantage of N-acetyl-perosamine replacing N-formyl-perosamine in O-PS is the possibility of differential diagnoses. This replacement of O-PS in <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> was easy to distinguish based on ELISAs and Western blotting [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-11-01273" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the differential diagnoses between A19 and A19mut2 vaccinations in mice based on ELISAs coated by wild-type LPS. The result was unexpectedly attractive; the mice vaccinated with A19mut2 were significantly distinguished from the ones vaccinated with the A19 strain. Applications of this in clinical samples and groups need to be further evaluated.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In conclusion, a <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19-deprived mutant strain, A19mut2, was successfully constructed with the modification of the O-PS, which can induce significant humoral and cellular immunity in immunized mice with a bias towards to a Th1-type immune response, as the A19 vaccination showed. The protection efficacy of the A19mut2 vaccination in mice was similar to that of the A19 strain. Wild-type LPS-coated ELISAs distinguished the mice antibodies induced by the A19mut2 and A19 vaccinations. The results indicated that A19mut2 could be used as a DIVA vaccine candidate in the future.</p>
