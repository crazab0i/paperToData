        <title>ABSTRACT</title>
        <p>Brucellosis is a major threat to public health and animal husbandry. Several <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> vertebrate models, such as mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, have been used to study <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> pathogenesis, bacteria-host interactions, and vaccine efficacy. However, these models have limitations whereas the invertebrate <italic toggle="yes">Galleria mellonella</italic> model is a cost-effective and ethical alternative. The aim of the present study was to examine the invertebrate <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> as an in vivo infection model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Infection assays were employed to validate the fitness of the larval model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection and virulence evaluation. The protective efficacy of immune sera was evaluated by pre-incubated with a lethal dose of bacteria before infection. The consistency between the mouse model and the larval model was confirmed by assessing the protective efficacy of two <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine strains. The results show that <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> could be infected by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains, in a dose- and temperature-dependent way. Moreover, this larval model can effectively evaluate the virulence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains in a manner consistent with that of mammalian infection models. Importantly, this model can assess the protective efficacy of vaccine immune sera within a day. Further investigation implied that haemolymph played a crucial role in the protective efficacy of immune sera. In conclusion, <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> could serve as a quick, efficient, and reliable model for evaluating the virulence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains and efficacy of immune sera in an ethical manner.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. It is viewed as a major threat to public health and animal husbandry, with annually about 500 thousand new reported cases worldwide, involving more than 170 countries and regions [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x2013;5</xref>]. Vaccines are the most cost-effective means to prevent and control brucellosis. Commercial veterinary live attenuated vaccines, such as <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> S19/A19, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> RB51, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> Rev.1, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> M5, and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella Suis</italic> S2, have played a substantial role in the prevention and control of brucellosis in livestock [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but they still have deficiencies, such as residual virulence to the host, interfering conventional serological tests, and resulting infection in humans [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x2013;12</xref>] (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Till now, the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> live attenuated vaccine 104M is the only human <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, but it is not suitable for mass vaccination due to scratch inoculation and residual virulence [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Rodents are the most commonly used animal models for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, virulence comparison, and vaccine evaluation, with bacterial load and histopathological changes in the spleen defined as main indicators [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, the evaluation process is time-consuming, costly, requires specialized animal housing, and is ethically challenging. Therefore, the establishment of a simple and time-saving alternative <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> infection and immune model of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> could not only greatly reduce the use of vertebrates but also speed up the evaluation process.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0001"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Commercial <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> attenuated vaccines and their virulence degree.</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col width="1*" align="left"/><col width="1*" align="left"/><col width="1*" align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Vaccine name</th><th align="center">Origin</th><th align="center">Degree of Virulence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">S19/A19</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic></td><td align="left">Cause abortion/orchitis [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]<break/>Virulent to humans [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">RB51</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic></td><td align="left">Virulent to humans [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>];</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Rev.1</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melitensis</italic></td><td align="left">More virulent than S19 [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]<break/>Cause abortion in pregnant animals [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>];<break/>Virulent to humans [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">M5</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melitensis</italic></td><td align="left">Virulent to humans [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S2</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">suis</italic></td><td align="left">Less virulent than S19 and Rev-1 [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">104M</td><td align="left"><italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic></td><td align="left">Slightly virulent to humans [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p><italic toggle="yes">Galleria mellonella</italic> larvae, also known as wax worms, are invertebrates with a mammal-like innate immune system that consists of cellular and humoral immune responses [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast to traditional models, <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae are an inexpensive and easily acquired resource that can be handled without difficulty, does not require feeding or specific caging, and thus could serve as a valuable tool for investigating microbial infections. Importantly, they can survive at 37&#xB0;C, which is the optimum temperature for human pathogens. In addition, this model is ethically acceptable and does not require ethical approval. As a result, this model has been widely used in the evaluation of pathogen virulence, toxicity of chemicals, and rapid screening of novel antibacterial agents [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26&#x2013;30</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we described a <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larval infection and immune model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and validated its potential to evaluate the virulence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains and the efficacy of immune sera in a fast, high-throughput, and ethical manner.</p>

        <p>All strains were stored at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C in tryptone soya broth (TSB; Oxoid) containing 15% glycerol (SCR). Bacteria were cultured in TSB at 37&#xB0;C with 220 rpm until the mid-log phase was reached. The samples were serially diluted and plated on tryptone soya agar (TSA, Oxoid) for CFU determination. <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> A19, A19&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">VirB12</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> S2 were obtained from Tecon Biology, and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 104M was obtained from Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products. The 104M:<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> overexpression mutant was generated as previously described [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> deletion mutant was generated by amplification of the upstream and downstream flanking regions and the kanamycin resistance gene (<italic toggle="yes">kanR</italic> gene) using the primers Omp19-up-F, Omp19-up-R, Omp19-down-F, Omp19-down-R, <italic toggle="yes">kanR</italic>-F, and <italic toggle="yes">kanR</italic>-R (Additional file 1). Subsequently, the upstream, <italic toggle="yes">kanR</italic> and downstream regions of Omp19 were ligated by overlapping PCR, and the ligated product was inserted into <italic toggle="yes">pEASY-Blunt</italic> 3 vector (Transgen Biotech). The resulting vector was transformed into the genome of strain 104M by electroporation at 625&#x2009;V for 10&#x2009;ms and then transferred to selective TSA plates containing 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;g/ml kanamycin..</p>

<italic toggle="yes">mellonella</italic> larval survival was <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> dose-dependent and temperature-dependent</title>
        <p>First, we determined the virulence of <italic toggle="yes">B.abortus</italic> A19 to <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae at 25&#xB0;C and 37&#xB0;C using 37&#xB0;C cultured strain A19, which were the optimum survival temperatures for larvae and bacteria, respectively. To begin with, larvae were injected with a series of doses of strain A19 at 25&#xB0;C to verify whether <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> could establish infection in <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae. Untreated larvae and larvae injected with PBS buffer both showed 100% survival when incubated at this temperature over a 5-day period, demonstrating that neither needle injection nor PBS buffer had any influence on larval survival. However, larvae infected with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of bacteria showed significantly decreased survival (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), with less than 20% survival on day 5; however, at lower infection doses, larvae showed almost 100% survival (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). We also employed a health index scoring system to assess the health status of larvae, which enabled the observation of general health status and slight differences in larval activity, cocoon formation, melanization, and survival (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The daily health index scores of larvae infected with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU dropped with time, eventually falling below 2 on day 5. The daily scores of larvae infected with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>7</sup> CFU were always above 6, although they decreased gradually. On the contrary, the health index scores of groups treated with doses lower that 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>7</sup> CFU were always above 8 (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>).</p>
        <p>We subsequently conducted the larval infection assay at 37&#xB0;C, as this was the optimal growth temperature for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. As expected, both untreated larvae and larvae injected with PBS buffer also exhibited 100% survival at 37&#xB0;C. Furthermore, larval survival was also dose-dependent at this temperature, with higher concentrations correlating with reduced survival. Larvae infected with less than 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>7</sup> CFU of strain A19 all survived, while at higher infection doses, a concentration-dependent pattern on both survival and health index scores was observed. All larvae died within 1 day and typically scored 0 or 2 when infected with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of strain A19, whereas 50% mortality was reached on day 1 with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>7</sup> CFU of bacteria (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Similar results were obtained using 25&#xB0;C cultured strain A19 (Fig. S1).</p>
        <p>Overall, larval survival depends on both the infection dose of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and the post infection incubation temperature. Consequently, a standard inoculum of 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/larva and a standard temperature of 37&#xB0;C were determined for all subsequent experiments, which killed all larvae consistently and reproducibly within a day.</p>

        <p>We subsequently evaluated the presence of virulence factors on larval survival by inoculating larvae with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of different <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains or their deletion/over-expression mutants. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> A19 and A19&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">VirB12</italic> are both commercially available live vaccines that show similar virulence in mice [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

Consistent with a previous report in the mouse model, strain A19 and strain A19&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">VirB12</italic> showed comparable pathogenicity in the larval model.

        <p>Next, as a proof of concept, we applied this model to examine the efficacy of 104M sera, since 104M live attenuated vaccine has already been proven to be highly protective against brucellosis [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

To optimize the pre-incubation time, bacteria were suspended in PBS buffer containing 50% (v/v) 104M immune sera or PBS sera and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 30, 45, or 60&#x2009;min. Larvae were then inoculated with a 25&#x2009;&#x3BC;l mixture containing 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of bacteria. It is not surprising that PBS sera had no protective effect on the larvae, regardless of the pre-incubation time. Contrastingly, 104M sera showed an excellent protective effect. The survival rates of groups pre-incubated with 104M sera for 30, 45, or 60&#x2009;min were 62.5%, 75%, and 87.5% on day 1, respectively (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). The protective efficacy of the 60-minute pre-incubated group outperformed the other two groups, as reflected in both the daily survival rates and health index scores (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Thus, 60&#x2009;min was employed as the pre-incubation time in subsequent studies.</p>
        <p>To determine the optimal sera concentration, strain A19 was suspended in PBS containing 1/2 diluted to 1/25 diluted [4%-50% (v/v)] 104M sera and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 60&#x2009;min before being inoculated into the larvae. Larval survival rates were all improved in the 104M sera pre-incubated groups by 58.3%-100% on day 1, compared with the PBS sera pre-treated group. All larvae inoculated with 1/25 diluted sera died by day 4, whereas those injected with 1/2 or 1/5 diluted sera showed more than 40% survival by day 5 (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Similar observations were apparent when comparing the health index scores of these different treated groups. Larvae in the 1/25 and 1/10 diluted 104M sera pre-incubated groups scored consistently lower than those in the 1/2 and 1/5 diluted 104M sera pre-incubated groups (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Therefore, these data indicate that 104M sera provide good protection against a lethal <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> challenge when pre-incubated with bacteria for 60&#x2009;min, with 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 diluted sera outperforming 1/25 diluted sera.</p>
        <p>Except for the total health index scores, individual indicator (activity, cocoon formation, melanization, and survival) scores also reflected that 104M sera had a good protective effect against A19 during the infection course. It is worth mentioning that differences in the protective efficacy of immune sera were already rather noticeable on the first day of infection (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>), suggesting that the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model offers the possibility to rapidly evaluate the efficacy of serum antibodies.</p>

        <title>Haemocytes play a major role in the protective effect of 104M sera</title>
        <p>To better understand the bacteria-larvae interaction and compare the histopathological differences between the 104M sera pre-incubated group and the PBS sera pre-incubated group, transverse sections of larvae were examined following H&amp;E or Koster&#x2019;s staining. Consistent with our expectations, larvae in the PBS sera pre-incubated group showed extensive tissue destruction, with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> scattered within the coelom (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b</xref>). In contrast, in the 104M sera pre-incubated group, bacteria were confined to the granuloma-like structures, thus preventing diffuse infection of the organism on day 1 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Additionally, an increase in the size of granulomatous-like lesions was observed on day 5 (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e,f</xref>).

        <p>One possible explanation for our observations is that the pre-incubation of bacteria and immune sera may contribute to the recognition, phagocytosis, and encapsulation of bacteria by larval haemocytes. To test this hypothesis, we injected larvae with CDLip to deplete haemocytes, or Lip as a control; after 24&#x2009;h, we exposed the larvae to the 104M sera pre-incubated bacteria, and measured larval survival over 5&#x2009;days. Lip and CDLip alone showed no significant toxicity towards larvae (data not shown). In line with our speculation, larval survival was significantly reduced in the CDLip pre-treated larvae, compared with the larvae pre-treated with Lip, indicating that the protective effect of 104M sera is dependent on larval haemocytes. However, it should be noted that pretreatment with CDLip only decreased, but did not completely inhibit, the protective effect of 104M sera, suggesting that several mechanisms may play a role in the protective effect of 104M sera (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a,b</xref>).

        <p>To verify whether the protective effect of 104M sera is complement-related, we further inactivated the serum complement.

The protective effect of the 104M sera was not affected by complement inactivation, suggesting that the serum complement is not relevant to the protective effect of the 104M sera in the larval model (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c,d</xref>).</p>

        <p>Several studies have shown that priming low-dose injections of microorganisms shielded the larvae from repeated exposure to the same or other microorganisms. To verify whether pre-exposure to a non-lethal dose of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains protects the larvae from a subsequent lethal challenge, groups of larvae were first primed with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>5</sup> CFU of live or fixed strain A19 through the last left proleg, followed by infection with 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of the same strain 24&#x2009;h later via the last right proleg. As expected, priming with a non-lethal dose of either live or fixed strains protected the larvae from a subsequent lethal challenge, with the live strain outperforming the fixed strain (<xref rid="f0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>).

However, this protective effect was rather limited because all larvae died on day 4 (Additional file 2). In contrast, the 104M sera pre-incubated group, consistent with the results from the mouse model, demonstrated a significant protective effect. 90% of the larvae survived on day 1 (<xref rid="f0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b</xref>) and the survival rate remained at 30% on day 5 (Additional file 2).

No abnormalities were observed in the spleen of the PBS-immunized, uninfected group, while in the PBS-immunized, challenged group and 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> immunized, challenged group, the number of splenic nodules was decreased, and hyperplasia of connective tissue around splenic nodules (red arrows) was observed, with punctate neutrophil infiltration (blue arrows). Large areas of extramedullary haematopoiesis can be observed in the red pulp (black arrows), accompanied by an increase in the number of multinucleated giant cells (yellow arrows). In contrast, fewer severe lesions in the spleen section were observed in the 104M immunized group, with small extramedullary haematopoietic foci (black arrows) and a slight increase in the number of multinucleated giant cells (yellow arrows). Similar observations were discovered when comparing lesions in the larval sections. Larval sections in the PBS sera pre-treated group showed extensive disruption of the tissue structure and diffuse distribution of bacteria, while those in the 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> sera pre-treated group only showed partial disruption. A portion of the bacteria was distributed in the haemocoel, while the remainder was encapsulated in the haemolymph nodes.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although there is an urgent demand for new strategies and therapies to control, combat, and eradicate brucellosis, this process is extremely slow. Animal models are indispensable for studying virulence, pathogenic mechanisms, bacteria-host interactions, and vaccine development of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. However, commonly used vertebrate evaluation models require feeding and housing, are time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> evaluation methods, such as the serum bactericidal activity assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration assay, are not recommended because of the potential for creating aerosols that are hazardous to laboratory personnel. As such, the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> evaluation model is of great value, as it offers a bridge between <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell assays and final vertebrate studies. The use of the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae model in pathogen-host interaction, virulence comparison, and antibiotic screening has been broadly investigated, but few studies have focused on this model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection or evaluation of immune serum efficacy. In 2014, Nicolas et al. presented a protocol to analyse the virulence of select agents, including two highly virulent <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains [<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, we report that <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae could be used as a complementary <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> model for infection and virulence comparison of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains. Also, we showed that this simple invertebrate model exhibited promise as a novel, fast, and efficient evaluation model for the efficacy of immune sera, which, to our knowledge, is a brand new finding.</p>
      <p>To characterize the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection model, we first evaluated the virulence of A19, an attenuated strain of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, to the larvae using a range of doses at 25&#xB0;C and 37&#xB0;C, and determined the survival of the larvae over a 5-day infection course. Also, the infection process was monitored by the health index scores of larvae. Larval survival occurred in a temperature- and dose-dependent manner. A dose of 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> A19 killed almost all the larvae by the end of infection regardless of the temperature, and a delay in larval death was observed when they were maintained at a lower temperature. This difference may be related to the growth disadvantage of bacteria at lower temperatures or the expression of temperature-dependent virulence factors. Similarly, health index scores correlated well with infection doses, with lower doses leading to higher scores. As a result, the infection dose of 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU and the incubation temperature of 37&#xB0;C were used in subsequent studies. In addition, the histopathological sections showed that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> was restricted to granuloma-like structures formed by haemocytes during non-lethal dose of infection, whereas bacteria were scattered throughout the course of the lethal dose of infection, indicating that larval death may be related to haemocyte depletion.</p>
      <p>Next, since the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larval model has been reported for the virulence evaluation of bacteria and fungi [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we compared the virulence differences between live bacteria and heat-inactivated bacteria. Live strain 104M and live strain A19 both killed the larvae completely at an inoculation dose of 1.25&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU, indicating that there was probably little difference in virulence between these two <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains in the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model. Meanwhile, the killing activity could be annulled by heat inactivation, which agreed with the results of Dijokaite et al. [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], implying that inactivated bacterial lysate and endotoxin did not play a significant role in larval survival. Strain A19 and strain A19&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">VirB12</italic> showed equal pathogenicity in the larval model, which is in keeping with an earlier report in the mouse model [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, the survival rate of larvae inoculated with the 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> deletion mutant was greatly increased at the same infection dose, proving that Omp19 is indeed a key virulence factor of strain 104M. In addition, strain S2 was less virulent in the larval model than strain A19, which is consistent with the results of previous studies [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Together, the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model could detect virulence differences of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains, and a good correlation has been established between the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model and the murine model. Therefore, the larval model might be a good substitute for the early evaluation of potential virulence genes when using a mammalian model, which might not be morally or practically appropriate. While preparing this article, a study was published by Aitor et al., which focused on utilizing the larval model to screen for potential <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> factors modulating innate immunity and yielded similar findings to our own [<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
      <p>After successfully established the larval model of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection and virulence evaluation, we determined the possibility of using this model to assess the efficacy of immune sera. As expected, the serum components did not affect the survival of <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic>, which is the prerequisite to the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model for evaluation of immune serum efficacy. Then, the protective efficacy of 104M immune sera was determined. Unsurprisingly, 104M sera provided good protection against a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> lethal challenge when incubated with bacteria in advance, while PBS sera showed no effect on preventing <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> induced larval death. This protective effect depends on both the concentration of immune sera and the co-incubation time of the bacteria and immune sera. These data highlight the potential of the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larvae model for the evaluation of immune serum efficacy. Notably, the differences in the survival rates and health index scores between the 104M sera and PBS sera were quite clear by day 1. Accordingly, the survival rates and health index scores on day 1 could be used as predictors of the overall protective effect without monitoring the larvae for 5&#x2009;days, which greatly shortens the experimental cycle.</p>
      <p>To explore the mechanisms underlying the protective efficacy of 104M sera in the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> model, histopathological differences between the 104M sera and PBS sera pre-treated groups were analysed. Strain A19 caused severe disseminated infection and tissue destruction in the PBS sera pre-treated group, whereas in the 104M sera pre-treated group, bacteria were confined to the granulomatous structures formed by haemocytes, thus preventing disseminated infection.</p>
      <p>We then depleted larval haemocytes to verify whether they cooperated with 104M sera. As expected, the protective effect of 104M sera decreased but did not completely disappear, indicating that multiple mechanisms may be involved in the protective effect of 104M immune sera. Additionally, we heat-inactivated the serum complement to determine whether it caused a difference in the serum protective efficacy. As the outcome demonstrates, complement is not important for understanding how 104M sera protects. Omp19 plays a significant role in bacterial adhesion, invasion, colonization, and intracellular survival; thus, it is considered a leading target for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines. To verify whether the protective efficacy of strain 104M decreases after deletion of Omp19, groups of larvae were primed with a non-lethal dose of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strain 104M and strain 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic>, followed by a lethal dose of strain A19 challenge. Indeed, priming with strain 104M or 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> could protect larvae from the lethal challenge, with strain 104M outcompeting strain 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic>, as reflected in the daily survival rate and health index scores of different groups. In line with our expectations, the protective effect of pre-immunization with a non-lethal dose of live vaccine was superior to that of the corresponding inactivated vaccine, demonstrating the reliability of the model.</p>
      <p>Finally, we compared the consistency between the larval and mouse models. A prophylactic study was performed in the mouse model, and the protective efficacy of strain 104M, 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> and PBS control were determined. As predicted, strain 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> showed a much lower protective efficacy than strain 104M, reflecting the difference in bacterial load. Subsequently, the protective efficacy of 104M sera, 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> sera, and PBS sera from the mouse study was determined using the larval model. Similarly, 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> sera showed much lower protective efficacy than 104M sera, following the same pattern as the mouse model. Further analysis of the histopathological changes also showed that strain 104M provided better protection than strain 104M&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">Omp19</italic> in the mouse and <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> models. Combined, these data highlight the correlation between the larval model and the mouse model, implying the potential of the larval model in immune sera evaluation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in the present study, we characterized a <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larval model for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection and virulence evaluation. Moreover, we report for the first time a <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larval model for potential evaluation of the protective efficacy of immune sera, which shortens the evaluation cycle to 1 day and therefore greatly accelerates the evaluation process. Future research will concentrate on the cellular, proteomic, and metabolomic responses to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> larval model. We anticipate that the <italic toggle="yes">G. mellonella</italic> infection and immune model will lessen our reliance on mammalian infection models, while enabling us to gain a better understanding of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> virulence factors, bacteria-host interactions, and vaccine development.</p>
