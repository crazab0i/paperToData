      <abstract>
        <p>Brucellosis remains a worldwide zoonotic disease with a serious impact on public health and livestock productivity. Controlling brucellosis in livestock is crucial for limiting human infections in the absence of effective human vaccines. Brucellosis control measures are majorly dependent on rigorous monitoring of disease outbreaks and mass vaccination of livestock. Live attenuated vaccines are available for livestock vaccination that play a vital role in brucellosis control programs in many countries. Even though the existing animal vaccines confer protection against brucellosis, they carry some drawbacks, including their infectivity to humans and interference with sero-monitoring. The available serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis depend on detecting anti-LPS antibodies in the serum. Since diagnosis plays a vital role in controlling brucellosis, developing improved serodiagnostic assays with enhanced specificity, sensitivity and DIVA capability is required. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel antigens for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. In the present study, we performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> protein microarray using brucellosis-positive human and animal serum samples. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> that exhibited common or differential reactivity with sera from animals and humans. Subsequently, we cloned, expressed, and purified ten serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their potential to develop next-generation vaccines and improved serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Further, we demonstrated the protective efficacy of one of the serodominant proteins against the <italic>B. melitensis</italic> challenge in mice. We found that the seroreactive protein, Dps (BMEI1980), strongly reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples, but it did not react with sera from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle, indicating DIVA capability. A prototype lateral flow assay and indirect ELISA based on Dps protein exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability. Thus, the present study identified promising candidates for developing improved vaccines and affordable, DIVA-capable serodiagnostic assays for animal and human brucellosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is one of the major economically important zoonotic diseases worldwide, which is posing a serious threat to both livestock and human health globally (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Mcdermott et al., 2013</xref>). Besides its impact on economic loss, brucellosis is also associated with high morbidity in many developing countries, both in humans and animals (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Rubach et al., 2013</xref>). Brucellosis remains endemic in different regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean basin (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Pappas et al., 2006</xref>). Brucellosis is caused by the Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria, <italic>Brucella</italic> belonging to the class Alphaproteobacteria (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Ficht, 2010</xref>). Depending on the host preference and pathogenicity, 12 species of <italic>Brucella</italic> have been identified to date, which can infect domestic, wild, and marine animals (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Scholz et al., 2016</xref>). Four classical <italic>Brucella</italic> species capable of causing severe brucellosis in humans are <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, followed by <italic>B. abortus</italic>, <italic>B. suis</italic>, and <italic>B. canis</italic>. Symptoms of brucellosis in animals are abortions, death of weaker offspring, stillbirth, and sterility in males, while in humans, it mainly causes flu-like symptoms with high fever, headache, weakness, and osteoarticular problems (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Godfroid et al., 2011</xref>). A severe form of brucellosis could be fatal with cardiac and neurological complications (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Solera et al., 1997</xref>). Brucellosis in humans is often an occupational hazard directly affecting veterinarians, laboratory technicians, abattoir workers, and farmers (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Agasthya et al., 2007</xref>). Human transmission could mainly occur through direct contact with infected or aborted animals, consuming contaminated dairy products, and inhaling aerosols (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Corbel, 1997</xref>). There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, and treatment with multiple antibiotic regimens is the only option to treat human brucellosis. However, antibiotic treatment is challenging due to frequent therapeutic failures and relapses (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Ariza et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>The most plausible way to control brucellosis is early disease diagnosis and mass vaccination of susceptible animals. However, diagnosis of brucellosis is challenging, and the available animal vaccines for brucellosis have many disadvantages despite conferring protection (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Schurig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Gali&#x144;ska and Zag&#xF3;rski, 2013</xref>). Brucellosis exhibits non-specific clinical manifestations that mimic the symptoms of other infectious or non-infectious diseases (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Mantur et al., 2007</xref>). Direct culturing of <italic>Brucella</italic> from the tissue specimens is considered the gold standard for diagnosing brucellosis. However, it is often avoided due to its fastidious nature, slow growth, and potential hazard to laboratory personnel (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Padilla Poester et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, other diagnostic methods have been developed and practiced over time that require no direct contact and do not require expertise and special equipment (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Yu, 2010</xref>). Therefore, serological detection of brucellosis is one of the most preferred diagnostic tools since this method addressed most of the challenges stated earlier. The serodiagnosis of brucellosis mainly relies on detecting anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies in the infected serum (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Godfroid et al., 2010</xref>). However, LPS-based serodiagnostic assays have significant drawbacks, including poor sensitivity, cross-reactivity with several other Gram-negative bacteria, and lack of the capability of Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA). Also, the tests fail to detect rough strains of <italic>Brucella</italic>, <italic>viz. B. canis</italic> and <italic>B. ovis</italic>, which lack O-side chains on their LPS (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Al Dahouk et al., 2003a</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Hence it is crucial to identify other serodominant antigens of <italic>Brucella</italic> that are exclusive and capable of addressing major shortcomings of the present serodiagnostic assays.</p>
      <p>Among the available animal vaccines, S19 and RB51 are the well-recognized live attenuated vaccines used for cattle (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Avila-Calder&#xF3;n et al., 2013</xref>). However, there are many disadvantages associated with these vaccines. The immune response induced by the S19 vaccine is still unclear, and it can induce abortion in pregnant animals. <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 vaccine has no DIVA capability, and most importantly, it is highly infectious to humans (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). RB51, a rough live attenuated strain of <italic>B. abortus</italic>, has DIVA capability where the vaccinated cattle can be differentiated from naturally infected animals using routine serodiagnostic tests (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Ashford et al., 2004</xref>). However, RB51 is rifampicin-resistant and can cause infection in humans. Subunit vaccines using <italic>Brucella</italic> recombinant proteins such as L7/L12 ribosomal protein, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, and Outer Membrane Lipoproteins (OMPs) OMP16 and OMP19 have been tested for brucellosis (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira and Splitter, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bae, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Pasquevich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">S&#xE1;ez et al., 2012</xref>). However, no subunit vaccines are currently available to prevent brucellosis in animals and humans. Therefore, the identification and characterization of novel serodominant antigens of <italic>Brucella</italic> are needed for developing improved vaccines and diagnostic assays for brucellosis. Here, we performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> antigens using a protein microarray. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> that are uniquely present or shared by various host species. Subsequently, we performed a detailed characterization of 10 serodominant proteins to assess their utility for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays. Further, we developed a prototype Lateral Flow Assay and indirect ELISA based on one of the serodominant proteins. The assays could detect brucellosis in humans and animals with high sensitivity and specificity and exhibited DIVA capability.</p>

        <title>High-throughput immunoprobing of the <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> protein microarray</title>
        <p><italic>Brucella melitensis</italic>, Bv.1 strain 16&#x2009;M proteome microarrays with a coverage of 99.5% were commercially procured from Antigen Discovery, USA (Cat. No. 12-MA-0001). The nitrocellulose microarray slides printed with ~3,000 <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins were analyzed with healthy and brucellosis-positive serum samples. Healthy and brucellosis-positive serum samples were obtained from veterinary diagnostic centers and farms with necessary approvals (Approval number: IBSC/2013/NIAB/0001B). <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated serum samples were obtained from different villages through government agencies as part of the ongoing brucellosis control program in India. Serum samples were primarily screened for the presence of seropositivity using the Rose Bengal Plate Agglutination Test (RBPT) and the presence of anti-<italic>Brucella</italic> antibodies was confirmed using OIE-validated, PrioCHECK<sup>&#x2122;</sup> Brucella Ab 2.0 Strip Kit (Applied Biosystems) and IDEXX Brucellosis Serum X2 Ab Test multi-species ELISA for animal sera. NovaLisa<sup>&#xAE;</sup> human IgG and NovaLisa<sup>&#xAE;</sup> human IgM kits (Nova Tec, Germany) for screening human sera. To perform RBPT, 25&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of Rose Bengal <italic>Brucella</italic> antigen and 25&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of serum sample were added onto the glass slides and mixed, followed by incubation for 5&#x2009;min and observation for agglutination. Indirect ELISAs were performed with the collected serum samples as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocols.</p>
        <p>Immunoprobing of protein microarray was performed as per instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the printed slides were assembled and blocked with 350&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of blocking buffer for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The kit control or test serum samples were diluted at a ratio of 1:100 in the pre-incubation solution (20% <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate in the blocking buffer) and incubated for 30&#x2009;min before adding onto the microarray slides. Subsequently, 350&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of diluted sera were added and incubated overnight at 4&#xB0; C in a humidified airtight container. Next, the slides were washed three times with 1&#x2009;mL of wash buffer for 5&#x2009;min each, followed by the addition of 350&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of diluted secondary antibody (1:1,000) onto the slides and incubated for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature. The slides were then washed thrice, followed by the addition of 350&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of diluted tertiary detection antibody and incubated for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were given a final wash and air-dried before being scanned with the Axon Genepix scanner (Molecular Devices).</p>
        <p>The background (true negative) signal was defined as the average signal of the negative control spots on the array. This enabled the comparison of the individual protein signal with the background signal to determine the significant response by protein antigens. The average of replicated spots was measured per sera, and the signal intensities obtained for sera from individual species were analyzed using the Genepix Pro 6.0 software.</p>

        <p>The BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring individual <italic>Brucella</italic> protein expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37&#xB0;C in Lauria Bertini media (LB, Himedia) supplemented with ampicillin (100&#x2009;&#x3BC;g/mL; Sigma). This starter culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth in 1/100 dilution and incubated at 37&#xB0;C until the OD at 600&#x2009;nm reached 0.6. The bacterial cultures were then induced with 1.0&#x2009;mM IPTG and incubated further for 5&#x2009;h at 37&#xB0;C. Subsequently, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> at 4&#xB0;C and washed once with PBS. Next, the bacterial cells were lysed in 50&#x2009;mL of sonication buffer containing 50&#x2009;mM sodium phosphate buffer with 300&#x2009;mM NaCl and 10&#x2009;mM imidazole. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> for 20&#x2009;min at 4&#xB0;C, followed by the supernatant collection. Subsequently, the supernatant was passed through the pre-equilibrated column packed with 1&#x2009;mL of Nickel-NTA Agarose resin (QIAGEN) at a flow rate of 1&#x2009;mL/min. The Ni-NTA column was then washed with 200&#x2009;mL of ice-cold wash buffer containing 50&#x2009;mM sodium phosphate buffer with 300&#x2009;mM NaCl and 30&#x2009;mM imidazole. The His-tagged protein immobilized on the Ni-NTA resin, was then eluted with the same buffer containing 300&#x2009;mM imidazole in various fractions. Next, SDS-PAGE was performed with the eluted fractions to assess their purity, and the protein-containing fractions were pooled. The residual LPS from the purified proteins was removed using polymyxin-B immobilized columns (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. Subsequently, the purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS overnight. After estimating the concentration by Bradford assay (Sigma), the proteins were aliquoted, followed by snap freezing and storing at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C for further experiments.</p>

        <title>Analyzing the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in immunized mice</title>
        <p>The antibody response against the purified proteins was estimated by iELISA (indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in the serum samples collected at various time intervals. Initially, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with respective purified recombinant proteins (100&#x2009;ng/well) at 4&#xB0;C. The wells were then washed thrice with 300&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of 1X phosphate buffered saline&#x2014;tween 20 (PBST) to remove the unbound proteins and blocked for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature with 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L/ well of 1% BSA prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The wells were washed thrice with 300&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of 1X PBST, followed by adding serum samples (100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L/ well) diluted in 1% BSA at a ratio of 1:100 to the respective wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2&#x2009;h. Subsequently, the wells were washed again as described earlier, followed by incubation with 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L/ well of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a antibody (Novus Biologicals) at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1&#x2009;h at 37&#xB0; C. Next, the wells were washed and incubated with 50&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of TMB substrate for 10&#x2013;15&#x2009;min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of 1&#x2009;N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The absorbance of the wells was measured at 450&#x2009;nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer).</p>
        <p>To analyze the population of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and IFN-&#x3B3; producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the spleens were aseptically harvested from immunized mice, followed by homogenization in sterile PBS. Subsequently, a single-cell suspension was prepared by passing the homogenized samples through 70&#x2009;&#x3BC;m cell strainers (BD Biosciences). The cells were washed twice with 10&#x2009;mL of PBS, and residual RBCs were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. The isolated splenocytes were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 6-well plates. Subsequently, the cells in the individual wells were stimulated with 5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g/mL of purified recombinant proteins for 48&#x2009;h at 37&#xB0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Brefeldin A (5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g/mL; Sigma) was added to the cells during the last 4&#x2009;h of culture. Next, the splenocytes were washed with PBS by centrifugation at 300 &#xD7; <italic>g</italic> for 10&#x2009;min at 4&#xB0;C and stained with PerCP-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a, PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-&#x3B3; antibodies (BioLegend) for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature in the dark. For CD4 and CD8a markers, surface staining was performed while IFN-&#x3B3; was stained intracellularly. Cells were fixed using ice-cold acetone and methanol in a 1:1 ratio, followed by permeabilization using 0.01 percent of Triton-X 100 (Sigma) in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis using LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). The lymphocytes were gated based on the scattering profiles of stains, and the percentage population of CD4 and CD8 positive cells as well as IFN-&#x3B3; producing cells, were quantified.</p>

The plates were incubated for 10&#x2013;15&#x2009;min, followed by reading absorbance at 450&#x2009;nm using an ELISA reader (PerkinElmer). For assessing the DIVA capability of Dps-based iELISA, the plates were coated with 100&#x2009;ng of Dps protein per well, followed by iELISA as described above using serum samples collected at 21, 45, and 90&#x2009;days post-<italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 vaccination. To evaluate the efficiency of Dps-based iELISA, human and cattle serum samples were screened using Dps-based iELISA, and the results were compared with that of commercially available, validated iELISA for human (NovaLisa) and cattle (PrioCheck) and RBPT. <italic>Brucella</italic>-culture positive/negative sera (bovine and mouse) and OIE-brucellosis positive/negative bovine reference serum samples were also screened using the Dps-based iELISA.</p>
        <p><italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 immune and healthy rabbit serum samples were obtained from the Translational Research Platform for Veterinary Biologicals (TRPVB). Dps-based iELISA was performed with <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 immune and healthy rabbit serum samples as described before and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:5000 (CST) dilution was used as the secondary antibody. To perform iELISA with <italic>Salmonella</italic> immune serum, the sera were raised in mice against formalin-inactivated <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. In brief, 6&#x2013;8&#x2009;weeks old female BALB/c mice were injected with 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of inactivated <italic>S</italic>. typhimurium (1&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>5</sup>) intraperitoneally. Serum samples were collected on day 21, followed by performing Dps-based iELISA as described before. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:5,000 (Novus Biologicals) was used as the secondary antibody for iELISA.</p>
        <p>To develop the prototype LFA, purified Dps protein and biotinylated bovine serum albumin (Abcam) were dispensed (1.5&#x2009;mg/mL) as test and control lines, respectively on the nitrocellulose membrane (mdi Membrane Technologies) using a flow dispenser (mdi Membrane Technologies). The protein G-gold (Abcam) and streptavidin-gold (Abcam) conjugates were mixed in a 4:1 ratio and coated on the pre-treated conjugate pad. Various components of LFA were assembled with the help of commercial source. To evaluate the prototype LFA, the serum samples (10&#x2009;&#x3BC;L) were applied to the sample applicator port, followed by 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of chase buffer to facilitate the sample migration toward the conjugate pad. Antibodies in the sample bound to the protein G-gold continue traveling up the nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-Dps antibodies in the samples were then bound to the Dps protein on the test line, producing a visible test line signal by an accumulation of gold particles on the test line. Streptavidin-gold conjugate bound to BSA-biotin on the control line produced a signal irrespective of the presence of anti-Dps antibodies in the samples. The absorbent pad absorbed excess liquid. The individual test was considered positive when a clear test line was visible or negative when only a control line was observed. To evaluate the LFA, 10 pooled brucellosis positive/negative/S19-vaccinated field serum samples of cattle, goat and humans were tested.</p>

        <title>High-throughput immunoprofiling of <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> protein microarray identified serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic></title>
        <p>High-throughput immunoprobing of microbial proteins facilitates the identification of serodominant antigens, which can be employed to develop vaccines and serodiagnostic assays. To identify and characterize the serodominant protein antigens of <italic>Brucella</italic>, we performed a high-throughput immunoprobing of the <italic>B. melitensis</italic> protein microarray using serum samples from healthy or brucellosis-positive cattle, goat, and human (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The commercially available full proteome microarray that contains ~3,000 proteins of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> was used for immunoprofiling. The brucellosis-positive serum samples that harbor antibodies against the serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> reacted with the respective proteins on the microarray (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The seroreactive proteins were detected by scanning the immunoprobed protein microarrays. The healthy human serum samples did not cross-react with any <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins on the array. However, we observed the reactivity of ELISA and RBPT-negative cattle and goat serum samples with some proteins on the array. Immunoprobing with brucellosis-positive serum samples of human, cattle, and goat detected various proteins on the array (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequently, the scanned images of arrays were analyzed for data acquisition and identification of seroreactive proteins. The antigens with a signal intensity of more than two standard deviations over the mean of signal intensities from negative controls were defined as serodominant antigens (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2010</xref>). The high-ranking serodominant proteins from individual species are illustrated as a heat map (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Among the 3,000 antigenic proteins screened, a set of 40, 43, and 120 antigens reacting with human, cattle and goat serum samples, respectively, were identified serodominant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The analysis also identified a set of 9 antigens that were equally seroreactive with all the species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>

        <title>Cloning, expression, and purification of selected serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic></title>
        <p>We identified many serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> using high-throughput immunoprobing of the <italic>B. melitensis</italic> protein microarray. To characterize these antigens further, we selected 10 serodominant proteins based on their seroreactivity and novelty. These proteins are either shared by brucellosis-positive animals and humans or uniquely expressed by individual species (<xref rid="tab6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The vaccine and diagnostic potentials of some of these serodominant proteins were not explored before. The coding sequences of respective proteins were amplified from the chromosomal DNA of <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, followed by cloning them into a pET21a(+) prokaryotic expression vector that harbors a C-terminal 6X His tag. Subsequently, the clones were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. To overexpress serodominant proteins, pET21a(+) harboring the <italic>Brucella</italic> genes were introduced into BL21DE3 <italic>E. coli.</italic> The overexpression of recombinant <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins was induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> using IPTG, followed by analyzing the expression levels by SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Next, the overexpressed <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins were purified using Nickel-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography, and the purity of the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Further, we examined the purified <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins by immunoblotting using an anti-His-tag antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The immunoblot showed overexpressed <italic>Brucella</italic> protein of expected size that further confirmed the identity of the recombinant proteins.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of the immunogenicity of purified sero-dominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> in mice</title>
        <p>The reactivity of <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins with brucellosis-positive serum samples suggests that these proteins are secreted or released by <italic>Brucella</italic> into the circulatory system of the host, resulting in the formation of antibodies against them. Since these proteins are immunogenic, they may induce <italic>Brucella</italic>-specific immune responses other than antibody generation in the host. To examine this, we analyzed the immunogenicity of purified <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins in mice. The mice were immunized with serodominant proteins, followed by the collection of blood samples at various days post-immunization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We used the immunogenic protein of <italic>Brucella</italic>, L7/L12 (BMEI0748) as the positive control as this antigen has been reported to induce a protective immune response in brucellosis (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira and Splitter, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, followed by analyzing various cell populations to determine the induction of cell-mediated immune responses. Serum samples collected on different days were analyzed for IgG1 and IgG2a levels to estimate the humoral immune response induced by these antigens (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We observed a high antibody titer in the immunized mice, indicating that these antigens are potent inducers of the humoral immune response. IgG1 and IgG2a are the markers of Th2 and Th1 responses, respectively, in mice where the Th1 response is reported to be important for protection against brucellosis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Golding et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Yingst and Hoover, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Skendros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Vitry et al., 2014</xref>). We observed a high titer of IgG2a antibody with BMEI1980, BMEI0063, BMEI0856, BMEI0916, BMEII1048, and BMEI0855 indicating a Th1 specific response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Brucella</italic> proteins, BMEI1513, BMEI0748, BMEI1390, and BMEII0154 exhibited induction of IgG1 response, suggesting a Th2 immune response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Evaluation of protective efficacy of serodominant proteins against <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> challenge</title>
        <p>Next, we performed a challenge study with <italic>B. melitensis</italic> using the mice immunized with four serodominant proteins <italic>viz</italic>. BMEI0856, BMEI0063, BMEI1513, and BMEI0748. Our immunogenicity studies revealed that the serodominant proteins, BMEI0856 and BMEI0063, induced a significant level of Th1 type immune response, whereas BMEI1513 induced a Th2 type response. The mice immunized with L7/L12 protein (BMEI0748) and adjuvant alone served as the positive and negative control groups, respectively. The immunized mice were challenged with <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, followed by harvesting the spleen and enumerating bacterial load at 2&#x2009;weeks post-infection. The protection efficiency of a vaccine candidate is determined by the significant reduction in the number of bacterial colonies in the spleen of immunized mice compared to the control. The mice immunized with BMEI0856 showed a significant reduction of CFU, indicating the protective effect of this protein against <italic>the B. melitensis</italic> challenge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).

        <p>The positive signals from the immunoprobed protein array indicated the seroreactivity of serodominant proteins with the respective antibodies in the brucellosis-positive serum samples. To confirm this data further, we examined the seroreactivity of purified serodominant proteins by immunoblotting. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, followed by transferring them onto the PVDF membrane. Subsequently, the immunoblots were incubated with healthy or brucellosis-positive cattle serum samples.

        <p>We observed strong reactivity of BMEI1980 with the brucellosis-positive serum samples of cattle and humans. The BMEI1980 encodes the DNA-binding protein from starved cells, Dps. A high throughput proteome analysis reported that the Dps protein is expressed only in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> 2,308 compared to the vaccine strain, <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Lamontagne et al., 2009</xref>). However, there was no experimental validation of this observation. Therefore, we performed a detailed characterization of Dps protein, intending to develop improved serodiagnostic assays with DIVA capability. We analyzed the immuno-reactivity of purified Dps protein with serum samples from animals and humans. The immunoblots of Dps protein were probed with healthy sera or brucellosis-positive human, goat, cattle, or <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle serum samples. The Dps protein was efficiently detected by brucellosis-positive serum samples from both animals and humans (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Further, we found that Dps protein failed to react with the serum sample from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle. To confirm the differential recognition of Dps protein, we performed immunoprobing of various concentrations of Dps protein with the sera from naturally infected or <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In agreement with previous data, the serum samples from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle did not detect Dps protein. We used LPS of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> as the negative and positive controls, respectively, for the immunoblots. Next, we probed the Dps blot with cattle serum samples collected at 21, 45, and 90&#x2009;days post-<italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccination. We did not observe any seroreactivity of Dps protein with serum samples after various days post-vaccination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The LPS of <italic>B. abortus</italic> reacted with the sera, which confirms that the serum samples are derived from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated animals.</p>

        <p>Next, we examined the reason behind the non-reactivity of Dps protein with the <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle sera.

        <title>Dps protein-based serodiagnostic assays exhibit DIVA capability and detect brucellosis in animals and humans</title>
        <p>Since both the animal and human sera efficiently recognized Dps protein, we wished to develop a lateral flow assay (LFA) and an indirect ELISA (iELISA) based on this protein. Toward developing iELISA, we determined the optimal concentration of Dps protein using the checkerboard titration assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Various concentrations of Dps protein were titrated against brucellosis-positive or negative human serum samples.

The cut-off value calculated for human serum samples was 0.45. The assay indicated that 1&#x2009;&#x3BC;g/mL of Dps protein was optimal for developing the iELISA. To develop the assay further, various blocking agents and antibody dilutions were optimized. One percent BSA was found suitable for testing human serum samples, whereas 3% BSA was optimal for cattle serum samples.

        <p>Next, the efficiency of Dps-based iELISA was compared with that of commercially available LPS-based iELISA or with RBPT. The validated LPS-based iELISA (NovaLisa) can detect brucellosis with human serum samples. Among the human serum samples tested, 26 sera were found to be positive by Dps protein-based iELISA, and 25 samples were positive by commercial iELISA. In contrast, only 14 samples were found positive by RBPT. A total of 195 samples were declared negative by all three tests. Both ELISAs had an agreement with 25 samples.

In the case of one sample, there was a disagreement between the two ELISA (<xref rid="tab7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>).

        <p>We have also evaluated the seroreactivity of Dps-based iELISA using <italic>Brucella</italic>-culture positive/negative bovine and mouse sera and OIE-brucellosis positive/negative bovine reference serum samples (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 4A,B</xref>). The assay indicated the detection of anti-Dps antibodies in the brucellosis positive reference serum samples. To examine the DIVA capability of iELISA, cattle serum samples were collected on various days post <italic>B.</italic> abortus S19 vaccination (21, 45, and 90&#x2009;days) and were screened using the Dps-based or LPS-based iELISA. The OD values of the known positive, negative, and <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated serum samples were estimated, and the cut-off values were derived as described before. All the <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated serum samples were seropositive with LPS-based iELISA, whereas these sera showed OD values similar to negative controls with Dps-based iELISA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The assay indicated that the Dps-based iELISA could differentiate <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated from naturally infected cattle.</p>
        <p>The LPS-based serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis have been reported to cross-react with the serum samples of animals infected with <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Al Dahouk et al., 2003a</xref>). Therefore, we examined the cross-reactivity of Dps-based iELISA with <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> immune sera. We did not observe any significant cross-reactivity with Dps-based iELISA against the <italic>Yersinia</italic> or <italic>Salmonella</italic> immune serum samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). To further confirm the experimental data, we performed an immunoblot with whole cell lysates of <italic>S. typhimurium, E. coli</italic> or <italic>B. abortus</italic>, followed by probing the membrane with <italic>Brucella</italic> anti-Dps antibody. The anti-Dps antibody did not cross-react with any proteins in the lysates of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> other than detecting the endogenous Dps protein in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> lysate (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Collectively, our experimental data indicate that Dps-based iELISA can specifically detect brucellosis positive sera samples without showing any cross-reactivity.</p>
        <p>Next, we developed a prototype LFA using Dps protein for pen-site application of this serodiagnostic assay. In the prototype LFA, Dps protein was used as the detection agent, while biotinylated bovine serum albumin was employed as the control. To examine the efficiency of LFA, healthy or brucellosis-positive humans, cattle, goat, and <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle were added to the LFA device. A test line could be observed with brucellosis-positive animal and human serum samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In agreement with our previous observation, Dps protein did not react with the sera from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle. The healthy serum samples gave no test line indicating no cross-reactivity with the Dps protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is an emerging zoonotic disease that seriously impacts human health and livestock productivity (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Mcdermott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Rubach et al., 2013</xref>). The intracellular niche and the ability to subvert host immune responses enable <italic>Brucella</italic> to cause chronic infection in the host, making treatment options often difficult (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Solera et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Godfroid et al., 2011</xref>). Since there is no human vaccine for brucellosis, controlling the disease in animals through mass vaccination is the only viable option to limit human infections. Early detection and culling/quarantine of infected animals are crucial for controlling the spread of brucellosis in livestock. However, the major drawbacks of available animal vaccines and serodiagnostic assays pose serious hurdles in brucellosis control programs in various countries (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Schurig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Gali&#x144;ska and Zag&#xF3;rski, 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to identify and characterize novel serodominant antigens of <italic>Brucella</italic> to address major shortcomings of presently available vaccines and serodiagnostic assays.</p>
      <p>Compared to other antigens, serodominant proteins are promising targets for developing improved diagnostic assays and vaccines. Once identified, these proteins can be expressed and purified from various expression systems making the process safer and cost-effective as large-scale culturing of the infectious pathogens and extraction of the antigens are not required. Serodiagnostic assays based on these recombinant proteins can provide higher sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhuri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Thavaselvam et al., 2010</xref>). These recombinant serodominant proteins could also serve as ideal candidates for developing safe and efficient vaccines for animal and human applications. Recent advancements in genomics and proteomics techniques permit large-scale screening for identifying serodominant proteins of pathogenic microorganisms (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2010</xref>). We used a full-proteome microarray of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> for the identification of serodominant proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic> from various host species. The immunoprofiling of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> proteins on the microarray yielded 202 potentially immunogenic proteins uniquely present or shared by multiple host species. Our analysis picked up many proteins of <italic>Brucella</italic>, such as BP26, ZunA, Cu-Zn SOD, Omp19, and Omp10, which were previously identified as serodominant and subsequently were used as candidate antigens for the development of either vaccines or serodiagnostic assays (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Pasquevich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">S&#xE1;ez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Fran&#xE7;a et al., 2014</xref>). These findings indicate the reliability of the experimental data generated in the present study. Subsequently, we evaluated the vaccine and diagnostic potential of 10 high-ranking immunogenic antigens, excluding previously reported well-characterized proteins.</p>
      <p>We cloned, overexpressed, and purified the selected serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their immunogenic potential to induce Th1 immune response against brucellosis in mice. Th1 type cellular immune response mainly involves generating IFN-&#x3B3; producing T-cell populations, antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, and a high titer of IgG2a is reported to confer protection in brucellosis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Golding et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Yingst and Hoover, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Skendros et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Vitry et al., 2014</xref>). Mice immunized with BMEI1980, BMEI1390, BMEI0063, BMEI0856, BMEI0916, BMEII1048, BMEI0855, BMEII0154, and BMEI0748, showed higher percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> cell population or IFN-&#x3B3; producing CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> cell population. Thus, suggesting a significant induction of Th1-type immune response. These proteins induced a high titer of IgG2a antibody, comparable to the response induced by the reported vaccine candidate, L7/L12 (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira and Splitter, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). Switching antibody response to the IgG2a type could facilitate antibody-mediated phagocytosis of extracellular <italic>Brucella</italic>, which can enhance bacterial clearance (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Splitter, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Vitry et al., 2014</xref>). The identified serodominant protein pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (BMEI0856) is a part of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex, which is reported to be involved in protein synthesis during <italic>Brucella</italic> stress response (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira-Gomes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Foth et al., 2005</xref>) The D-ribose-binding-periplasmic protein precursor (BMEI1390) is one of the sugar-binding proteins that help in sugar uptake to synthesize complex cell constituents (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2002</xref>). The DNA starvation stationary phase protection (Dps, BMEI1980) is a part of the stress response system that binds non-specifically to DNA during oxidative stress (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Martinez and Kolter, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Roop 2nd et al., 2003</xref>). BMEII1048 encodes the molecular chaperonin, GroEL, a member of the heat shock protein family that plays a vital role in the structure and folding of other proteins (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Abbady et al., 2012</xref>). GroEL has been reported to be a potent inducer of host immune responses (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Leclerq et al., 2002</xref>). The 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (BMEI0748) is associated with translation initiation and is critical for ribosomal translocation (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Carlson et al., 2017</xref>). The protective efficiency of this serodominant protein has been confirmed earlier, therefore L7/L12 was employed as the positive control in this study. BMEI0855 gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit beta of the pyruvate dehydrogenase protein complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. The expression of this protein is reported to be down-regulated under heat stress (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira-Gomes et al., 2000</xref>). BMEII0154 codes for MotB family protein that is a part of the stator of the flagellar motor protein complex. MotB mutations have been studied earlier to determine their vital role in establishing chronic infection (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Fretin et al., 2005</xref>). The genes BMEI0916 and BMEI0063 code for hypothetical proteins where the functions of these proteins are yet to be established.</p>
      <p>Our experimental data suggest that these serodominant proteins are potential candidates for developing next-generation vaccines for brucellosis. To validate this, a challenge study was performed to examine the protective efficiency of the serodominant proteins against <italic>B. melitensis</italic> in mice. The serodominant protein, BMEI0856 that induced a Th1 response conferred a significant level of protection against challenge with <italic>B. melitensis</italic>. The protective efficacy of BMEI0856 has appeared to be superior to that of the reported <italic>Brucella</italic> vaccine candidate, L7/L12. Even though we observed induction of Th1 type response by BMEI0063, it did not confer any significant level of protection against <italic>B. melitensis</italic> challenge compared to BME0856 and L7/L12. The serodominant protein, BMEI1513, that induced a Th2 type response failed to confer any protection highlighting the importance of Th1 type immune response for clearance of <italic>Brucella</italic>. The preliminary data obtained from the <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge study indicate that BMEI0856 could serve as an ideal candidate for developing a next-generation vaccine for brucellosis. Our future experiments will examine the utility of other serodominant proteins for vaccine development.</p>
      <p>Antigens that induce a robust antibody response can serve as ideal candidates for developing improved serodiagnosis assays. We evaluated the seroreactivity of purified serodominant proteins by immunoblotting with brucellosis-positive and negative serum samples from cattle and humans. Even though all the tested proteins reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples with different efficiency, Dps protein exhibited strong seroreactivity with both animal and human sera. We did not observe any cross-reactivity of Dps protein with serum samples from healthy animals or humans. The Dps protein is a part of Proteobacteria&#x2019;s &#x3C3;E1 stress response system and is reported to play a crucial role in the stress survival and chronic infection of <italic>Brucella</italic> (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that <italic>Brucella</italic> secretes Dps protein in the infected macrophages that mediate ferritinophagy activation and host cell necrosis to facilitate the egress and bacterial dissemination (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Hop et al., 2023</xref>). This may release Dps into the circulatory system to generate a potent antibody response in the <italic>Brucella</italic>-infected host.</p>
      <p>A DIVA-capable serodiagnostic assay is essential when a whole-cell vaccine is used for administration. The principle of DIVA is eliciting an antibody response against the pathogen that is different from the response induced due to vaccination. Thus, distinguishing an infected animal from the vaccinated in a serological analysis is based on the antigen lacking in the vaccine candidate. DIVA vaccines may lack one or more immunological protein antigens that are present in the natural form of a pathogen. A previous study had identified many proteins, including Dps that were differentially expressed in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 vaccine strain (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Lamontagne et al., 2009</xref>). However, no experimental validation of this data was performed to examine the serodiagnostic potential of Dps protein for developing improved sero-monitoring assays with DIVA capability. Since our screening also identified Dps protein and showed robust immunogenicity in mice, we sought to examine its potential to serve as a candidate for developing improved serodiagnostic assays. Detailed immunoprobing of purified Dps protein with serum samples from naturally infected or <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle indicated that Dps exhibits DIVA capability where it reacted only with the sera from naturally infected cattle and not with the serum samples from <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated animals. Further, no seroreactivity was observed when Dps protein was probed with sera from cattle after various days of <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 vaccination. These data imply that the S19 vaccine strain of <italic>B. abortus</italic> may not express Dps protein. However, the Dps gene is present on chromosome I of <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19, similar to its parent strain, <italic>B. abortus</italic> (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Pajuaba et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether Dps protein is expressed in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 strain. Our subsequent immunoblotting experiments indicated a minimal expression of Dps protein in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 strain compared to the wild-type <italic>B. abortus</italic>. Since the expression of Dps is low in the <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19 strain, it appears that the antibody response in the vaccinated animals is undetectable, which provides the DIVA capability.</p>
      <p>Given that Dps protein reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples from animals and humans and exhibited DIVA capability, we wished to develop Dps-based serodiagnostic assays. A prototype LFA based on the Dps protein efficiently detected brucellosis-positive serum samples from animals and humans indicating its utility in point-of-care applications. Further, the LFA could differentiate vaccinated from naturally infected cattle. Toward developing the iELISA, we optimized various assay parameters such as Dps concentration, blocking agent, and optimal serum and secondary antibody dilutions. Subsequently, we prepared the iELISA kits and compared their efficiency with the commercially available brucellosis detection kits. An in-house assay validation with human sera samples showed 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity for the Dps protein-based iELISA. Further, the Dps-based iELISA and LFA showed DIVA capability with bovine serum samples where the vaccinated cattle were assay negative compared to the naturally infected animals. The cross-reactivity with the immune sera of Gram-negative bacteria, especially <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic> is a major drawback of existing LPS-based serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Our experimental data indicate that Dps-based iELISA does not exhibit any cross-reactivity with the immune sera of <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 or <italic>S. typhimurium.</italic> Collectively, our studies suggest that Dps-based LFA and iELISA could serve as ideal diagnostic tools for brucellosis control programs where assays with high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capabilities are required.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our high throughput immunoprobing of <italic>B. melitensis</italic> protein microarray identified many potential candidates for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays for animal and human brucellosis. Some of the serodominant proteins induced a robust Th1-type response indicating their potential to serve as ideal candidates for developing next-generation vaccines. In accordance with this, BMEI0856 conferred protection against challenge with <italic>B. melitensis</italic> in mice. Among the identified serodominant proteins, Dps exhibited robust seroreactivity with brucellosis-positive sera from both humans and animals except with <italic>B. abortus</italic> S19-vaccinated cattle sera. The Dps-based LFA and iELISA exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability. The recombinant Dps protein, peptides from Dps, or anti-Dps antibodies could be used for developing other sensitive point-of-care diagnostic assays and biosensors for the detection of animal and human brucellosis in a cost-effective manner.</p>
