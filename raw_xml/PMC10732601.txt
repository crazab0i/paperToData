      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonotic bacterial disease, with approximately 500,000 new human cases each year [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and with millions of livestock either infected or at risk. However, these figures are often underestimated, mainly because the symptoms in humans are not specific [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], leading to frequent misdiagnosis of the disease [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Brucellosis causes serious chronic diseases in humans that require long-term and costly antibiotic treatment. It also causes abortion or infertility in animals [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and limits the international trade market of cattle products [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the statistics, brucellosis has caused tremendous annual economic losses in the world, including US$32 and US$60 million in Brazil and Argentina every year, respectively [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, in China, sheep brucellosis alone has resulted in a direct economic loss exceeding US$300 million [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, considering that brucellosis threatens human and animal health and causes poverty, it has been ranked among the top seven &#x201C;neglected zoonoses&#x201D; by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Brucellosis is caused by the Gram-negative and facultative intracellular bacteria <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, which includes more than 10 species, with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> the most virulent species that cause illness in humans [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>At present, there is no licenced vaccine for human use, and the three most commonly used live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines are S19 and RB51 for cattle, and Rev1 for small ruminants [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although the use of these vaccines has effectively controlled the spread of brucellosis in humans and animals, they are still far from ideal because they are pathogenic to humans, have residual toxicity to animals, and cannot induce full protection against infection with virulent strains [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, three types of vaccines for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> are under research and development. The first is recombinant protein vaccines, which have the advantages of high yield and purity, well-defined components, and good safety without virulence [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, adjuvants are needed to enhance the immune effect due to the low immunogenicity of this type of vaccine [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The choice of adjuvants is crucial for the protection of recombinant protein vaccines [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The second type is DNA vaccines, which are economical and can induce potent Th1 and CTL reactions [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, there are problems with scale-up when testing these vaccines in larger animal models and even in humans [<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The last type is live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines with further mutations and attenuation. Although their protective effect has been confirmed in large animals, excessive mutations may lead to reduced protection [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current live attenuated vaccines do not provide protection across different species of animal hosts, and considering the re-emergence of brucellosis worldwide and increasing incidences in humans, a safe and effective vaccine that induces cross-protection in humans and animals is imperative.</p>
      <p>The surface carbohydrates of bacteria, mainly capsular polysaccharides and <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-polysaccharides (OPSs), have long been considered as the ideal target of bacterial vaccines. The polysaccharide conjugate vaccines produced by covalently linking a bacterial polysaccharide to a carrier protein are some of the safest and most efficacious vaccines in use today [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It was reported that the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS enabled the establishment of an intracellular niche and enhanced the survival and persistence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It also dominates the antibody response of the host [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS antibodies are functional and may contribute to preventing infection by activating a complement-mediated cell-killing mechanism [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which indicates that the vaccination effectiveness against brucellosis may be improved by development of an anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>-OPS conjugate vaccine. The <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS is a block copolymer of variably linked &#x3B1;1,2- and &#x3B1;1,3&#x2013;4,6-dideoxy-4-formamido-D-mannopyranosyls (D-Rha4NFo). The A antigen is characterized by &#x3B1;1,2 linkages, which is typical of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> and of some <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> biovars. The M antigen corresponds to the presence of both &#x3B1;1,2 and &#x3B1;1,3 linkages and is characteristic of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The OPS of <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> serotype O:9 is a homopolymer that consists exclusively of &#x3B1;1,2-linked D-Rha4NFo units [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and is highly similar to the OPS of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Considering that <italic toggle="yes">Y</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">enterocolitica</italic> O:9 is safer and easier to culture than <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, we used <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 as engineered cells to prepare the conjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> through protein glycan coupling technology [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this vaccine did not provide satisfactory protection against other <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> virulent species, especially <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, the most severe infections in humans [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Nanoparticles (NPs), as an adjuvant and delivery system, have shown great potential in subunit vaccine development [<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They offer several advantages, including protection of the bioactivity of encapsulated payloads and facilitation of antigen presentation, which lead to more potent immune activation [<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To date, many types of NPs have been utilized to develop nanovaccines, such as inorganic NPs, virus-like particles, liposomes, and self-assembled protein particles [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x2013;24</xref>]. Among them, proteinaceous delivery vectors have obvious potential advantages due to their biocompatibility and safety [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At present, many methods have been used to load antigens with NPs [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#x2013;26</xref>]. NPs with covalently-loaded antigens can generate stronger immune responses than physical mixing [<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the efficient loading of polysaccharide antigens still faces many difficulties. Our previous study developed a fully protein-based, self-assembling Nano-B5 platform, in which polysaccharide antigens were covalently linked to a nanoparticle [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, with this system, we attempted to prepare a novel and more efficient <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine.</p>
      <p>In this study, we produced a high-performance bioconjugate vaccine against different species of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> by introducing a Nano-B5 platform and a O-linked glycosylation system into the <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> serotype O:9. A series of mouse experiments demonstrated that the nanovaccine greatly promoted antibody responses and provided protection against virulent strains (<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic>). Overall, for the first time, we have biosynthesized a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> nanovaccine, which showed significant and extensive protective effects.</p>

A19 and M5&#x2013;90 were cultured at 37&#xB0;C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) liquid medium with 200 rpm shaking or on solid TSA medium (TSB medium containing 1.5% agar). YeO9_52212 was cultured at 25&#xB0;C in BHI liquid or on solid medium. For expression, strains were grown at 25&#xB0;C until the culture density at 600&#x2009;nm was approximately 0.8, at which time isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1&#x2009;mM was added, and the cells were further cultured for 14&#x2013;16&#x2009;h.</p>

        <title>Protein purification</title>
        <p>IPTG-induced cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended with buffer A (0.5&#x2009;M NaCl, 10&#x2009;mM imidazole, and 20&#x2009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by a high-pressure homogenizer (Ph.D. Technology LLC, Saint Paul, USA), and the precipitate was discarded by centrifugation twice (at 8,000&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10&#x2009;min at 4&#xB0;C). The supernatant of the lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni affinity column (cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin, Roche, Penzberg, Germany) at 4&#x2009;mL/min. After washing with a volume of buffer A 10 times the column volume, the target proteins were eluted with buffer B (0.5&#x2009;M NaCl, 0.5&#x2009;M imidazole, and 20&#x2009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Then, the product was separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Briefly, the concentrate was loaded onto a Superdex 200 Prep Grade column (16&#x2009;mm&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;1,000&#x2009;mm; GE Healthcare, Beijing, China) using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as the mobile phase at 1&#x2009;mL/min. The protein solution was collected in a 5-mL tube and verified by Coomassie blue staining.</p>

        <p>LPS extraction was performed as described previously [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, YeO9_52212 was cultured at 25&#xB0;C with 200 rpm shaking for 24&#x2009;h, and pellet was collected by centrifugation. The bacteria were washed three times with distilled water. The bacteria were weighed and resuspended with distilled water at a bacteria/water ratio of 1&#x2009;g/3&#x2009;mL. After alternating three times between ice and hot water baths, an equal volume of 90% phenol was added to the cells and the mixture was shaken in a 68&#xB0;C water bath for 30&#x2009;min. The water layer was extracted and this step was repeated.

Next, 200&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of blocking buffer (PBST +5% skimmed milk powder) was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4&#xB0;C. The mouse serum samples were diluted with dilution buffer (PBST +0.5% skimmed milk powder) and added to each well (100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L/well) of the immunoplate after it was patted dry, and then the plate was incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 1&#x2009;h. After washing and drying, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, or IgG2a (Abcam, Shanghai, China) antibody was diluted 50,000 times with dilution buffer and added to each well (100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L/well). After another incubation, washing, and drying step, a Soluble TMB kit (CWbio, Beijing, China) was used to initiate the colour reaction. The microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance with a detection wavelength of 450&#x2009;nm.</p>

        <title>Construction and characterisation of CTBTri-OPS<sub>Ba</sub></title>
        <p>In previous studies, we demonstrated that the O-linked glycosylation system in <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 successfully biosynthesized a conjugate vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Although this glycoprotein showed a good protective effect against the <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">abortus</italic> strain [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we found that it provided poor protection against <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melitensis</italic>, the most prevalent strain of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> at present [<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To solve this problem, we prepared a bioconjugate vaccine by establishing a self-assembled nano delivery system to obtain an enhanced protective immune effect against <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">melitensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> strains (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). First, the plasmid pPglL-CTBTri, which co-expressed the O-oligosaccharyltransferase PglL and carrier protein CTBTri4573, was introduced into the YeO9_52212&#x394;<italic toggle="yes">rfaL</italic> strain (the O-antigen ligase gene deletion strain of YeO9_52212 strain) [<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CTBTri contains a cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), a trimer forming peptide (Tri), a glycosylation sequence (4573) and a 6&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;His tag, from the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>- to C-terminal. The monomer self-assembled into nanoparticles after expression. Because the glycosylation was carried out in the periplasm, an additional signal peptide was also added upstream of the CTBTri4573 sequence to ensure its successful localization (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). After IPTG induction and overnight culture, the whole-cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analysed by Coomassie blue staining and western blotting using a 6&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;His Tag antibody. As expected, when PglL and the carrier protein were co-expressed, OPS<sub>Ba</sub> linked to the carrier protein under the catalysis of PglL, and typical glycosylation ladder bands were observed (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). CTBTri was efficiently glycosylated, and due to the addition of the Tri sequence, the glycoprotein CTBTri-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> showed a clear shift in the molecular weight compared with CTB-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> (C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>) or CTB as a carrier (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). After purification by Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography and SEC, the glycoproteins were detected by Coomassie blue staining and western blotting using a 6&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;His tag antibody, and the results showed that the purity of CTBTri-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was over 90%. To further confirm the specificity of OPS, anti-<italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9- and anti-<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>-specific monoclonal antibodies were used for western blotting, and the results showed that the polysaccharide fraction reacted with both specific antibodies (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Having confirmed the successful expression of glycoprotein CTBTri-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> in YeO9_52212, we then analysed whether it existed at the nanometre scale. First, CTBTri-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the results showed particles of about 25&#x2009;nm in diameter (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), indicating that CTBTri monomers successfully self-assembled into nanoparticles. Then, the nanovaccine (NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>) solution was analysed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the results showed that NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was monodispersed and the particle size was consistent with the results of TEM (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>). To further detect the stability of the nanovaccine, NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was stored at room temperature for 7&#x2009;days and analysed by DLS and Coomassie blue staining. The results revealed that the particles were stable without any degradation or depolymerization under the long-term room temperature storage (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref> Fig. S1).

During the 15&#x2009;days after immunization, there were no significant differences in body temperature or weight change between normal and immunized mice (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) Then, we measured the major inflammatory factors, IL-1&#x3B2; and IFN-&#x3B3;, in the serum, and the results showed that these two cytokines were not detected in the serum of either the immunized and normal mice, suggesting that the nanovaccine did not induce an inflammatory response (Fig. S2). In addition, we performed a histological analysis of the organs, including heart, liver, kidney, lung, and spleen, 15&#x2009;days after administration and found no pathological phenomena detected in any of the tissue sections (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) Furthermore, to determine whether high doses of vaccine affected the liver and kidney function of mice, we measured several biochemical indices, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum on the 28th day after injection, and all the biomarkers in both immunized and normal mice were within the normal range (Fig. S3) These results showed that the nanovaccine was safe and appropriate for continued evaluation.

        <title>The nanovaccine induces a potent OPS-specific antibody response and provides good cross-protection against a lethal dose challenge of Brucella</title>
        <p>After confirming the safety of NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> in mice, we further assessed the immunogenicity of the nanovaccine. Generally, nano carriers can effectively enhance specific immune responses. Therefore, we reduced the dose of NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> to 1.25&#x2009;&#x3BC;g polysaccharide/mouse (half of the traditional dose) by evaluating the immune effect of different doses (Fig. S4). Then, six-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups (10 mice/group), and were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> (2.5&#x2009;&#x3BC;g polysaccharide/mouse), or NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> (1.25&#x2009;&#x3BC;g polysaccharide/mouse) on day 0, 14 and 28 (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The tail-tip blood of each group was collected 10&#x2009;days after the third immunization. The ELISA results showed that NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> elicited significantly higher IgG titres against YeO9_52212 LPS in the serum of immunized mice than did C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). We further measured the IgG1 and IgG2a antibody titres and the results revealed that both subtype titres were substantially increased in the group immunized with NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub>, indicating that the nanovaccine enhanced both Th1 and Th2 immune responses (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). By analysing the ratio IgG1/IgG2a, we found that a lower IgG1/IgG2a ratio in NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group was detected compared with the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), suggesting that the nanovaccine mainly enhanced the OPS-specific Th1-biased immune responses.

        <p>Having demonstrated that the nanovaccine elicited high specific antibodies levels against YeO9_52212 LPS, we then used a lethal mouse model to evaluate its protection effect in a <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> challenge. Two weeks after the last immunization, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 6.4&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain A19. During the 14-day-long observation period, no mice died in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> groups, while 60% of the mice died in the PBS group (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). In addition, when the immunized mice were challenged with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> strain M5&#x2013;90 (4.0&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse), all mice in the PBS group were dead within 2&#x2009;days. The survival rate in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group was only 20% but up to 100% in the NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Moreover, we also tested the effect against 6.3&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mouse <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> S2 and the results showed that the nano conjugate vaccine provided 100% protection against the <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> strain S2, while the survival rate in PBS group was 30% (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>).

Six-week-old BALB/c mice were grouped and immunized as described above and then infected with non-lethal dose of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). After infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, two obvious indicators, weight loss and TNF-&#x3B1; secretion, were determined. The weight of mice in each group decreased significantly after infection with <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> strain M5&#x2013;90. The maximum weight loss was about 4&#x2009;g in the PBS group, the weight loss in the C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group was about 1.7&#x2009;g, and only 0.72&#x2009;g in the NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). We also measured the expression level of TNF-&#x3B1; in the serum of mice, the TNF-&#x3B1; level in the serum of infected mice increased gradually. The difference among groups were the most significant on the fifth day. The highest level of TNF-&#x3B1; was detected in the PBS group, while immunisation of C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> effectively reduced serum TNF-a levels in the mice, and the effect of NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> was the strongest (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>).

On the fifth day post-infection, the spleens of mice were removed and homogenized, after which the <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> in spleens were counted. From the results, we found that although both C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> and NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> reduced the <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> burden in the spleens of mice compared to PBS, NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> induced a stronger protective effect in immunized mice and the log units of protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> was 0.95 (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). We also measure these dates in the non-lethal dose infection with the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain A19, a similar trend was found in the immunized mice infected with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain A19. The average weight of mice in the PBS group decreased by 3&#x2009;g at most, and that in the NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> groups was about 1&#x2009;g, the protection unit in the NP-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group was also higher than C-OPS<sub>Ba</sub> group (Fig. S5).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Due to the weak immunogenicity of the polysaccharide antigen itself, the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> conjugate vaccine we prepared earlier [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] did not provide cross-protection against different <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species. To solve this problem, the Nano-B5 platform was introduced to further enhance the immune response of the OPS. Compared with the conjugate vaccine produced before, the nanovaccine induced a more potent antibody response and provided 100% protection against a lethal-dose challenge of the three species of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, and particularly against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>. After non-lethal dose infection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, the nanovaccine immunization also alleviated both the weight loss and increased serum TNF-&#x3B1; concentration, and decreased the bacterial load in the spleen of mice. These results demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the OPS was enhanced by conjugation with NPs.</p>
      <p>Many proteins have been used to prepare <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> subunit vaccines, such as ribosomal protein L7/L12 [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase [<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and several outer membrane proteins such as Omp19 [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Omp31 [<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and their immune protection was verified in animal experiments [<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the difficulties involved in the identification of protective antigens and the need for concomitant use of adjuvants have limited the development and application of subunit vaccines [<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast to protein antigens, the OPS of pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> are conservative, and are block copolymers formed by variably linked &#x3B1;1,2- and &#x3B1;1,3-D-Rha4NFo [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS antibody produced after vaccination or natural infection could kill <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in vitro, which showed that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS is also an ideal protective antigen in vaccine design. Therefore, the successful development of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS-conjugate vaccine could induce high levels of functional antibodies [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the principal method to monitor brucellosis in animal populations is serology. Although continuous progress has been made in the serodiagnosis of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, all the assays use diagnostic antigens that are rich in OPS [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OPS has been considered as a flaw in vaccination policy because it can hamper the distinction between infected animals and vaccinated animals [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It was reported that anti-OPS antibodies produced by chemically synthesized polysaccharide conjugates are used for serodiagnosis, and the antibody is unlike antibodies produced by various whole cell live vaccines. These anti-OPS antibodies only produce a dominant immune response against the &#x3B1;1,2-linked Rha4NFo units, which suggested that the serodiagnosis based upon the M and terminal epitopes (&#x3B1;1,3-linked) provided an important approach for a viable method to differentiate infected and vaccinated animals [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our study, we used <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9 to produce glycoprotein, as the OPS in this glycoprotein does not contain &#x3B1;1,3-linked Rha4NFo units and can be distinguished from natural infection based on the above serological diagnosis methods.</p>
      <p>At present, several NPs have been used as carriers to prepare polysaccharide conjugated vaccines. Chemical cross-linking is the most common method to connect polysaccharides with NPs, such as virus-like particles and gold NPs [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, this method often involves multiple steps, and may produce heterogeneous products [<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, the Nano-B5 vaccine platform we used with certain glycosylation modification sites placed at predetermined selective sites avoided uneven decoration products. In addition, we used the OPS of the engineered bacteria, <italic toggle="yes">Y. enterocolitica</italic> O:9, to modify the NPs, which ensured their natural conformation and fidelity of the polysaccharide structure. The coupling process of NPs and polysaccharides was regulated in the bacteria, and there was no danger of distortion of the structure from uncontrolled conjugation. The potential toxicity of NPs has been a concern that limited their application in biomedicine. Owing to their small size, NPs can easily enter numerous body tissues and organs, resulting in accumulation in the cell [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our results showed that the proteinaceous NPs we used were safe and biocompatible; no drug-related toxicity signs were detected in the test mice within 30&#x2009;days after a single high-dose vaccine immunization, and there was no difference in weight gain or visceral organ morphology between the test mice and healthy mice.</p>
      <p>NPs promote the complement cascade, and then promote the recruitment of immune cells and activation of antigen-presenting cells, thus enhancing the antibody response and overall immune response [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The antibody titres of mice immunized with the nanovaccine increased significantly, particularly the IgG2a titre, indicating that the OPS-specific Th1-biased immune responses were improved. Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are crucial in protection against brucellosis, which may be the most important reason for the improved protective effect of the nanovaccines. The nanovaccine offered good protection in mice against a lethal dose challenge of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. This may be because when a large number of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> enter the body, they first enter the bloodstream, and are killed by antibody through the complement-mediated bactericidal activity, therefore protecting the mice from death. In short, our results have confirmed that the high level of antibody response against an OPS without &#x3B1;1,3 linkages played an important role in protective immunity against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. Due to the complex pathogenic mechanism of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, the multi-component vaccines based on NPs may be an effective strategy. OPS can be used as a fixed component in multi-component vaccines, and protein antigens that can induce cellular immunity are also needed. This type of vaccine is expected to provide effective protection for humans and animals. This finding also greatly reduces the time and cost required for antigen screening.</p>
