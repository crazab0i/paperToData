The present study determined a relative level of protection conferred by each single strain. Upon virulent challenge, the challenge strain was recovered most abundantly in non-immunized control mice, with the ST-Omp19-, ST-BLS-, LPS-, and ST-SOD-immunized mice showing much less burden. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay also confirmed the induction of antigen-specific immunoglobulin G for each antigen delivered. In a route-wise comparison of the combined vaccine candidate, intraperitoneal (IP), intramuscular (IM), and subcutaneous immunizations revealed an indication of highly efficient routes of protection. Splenocytes of mice immunized via IM and IP routes showed significant relative expression of IL-17 upon antigenic pulsing. Taken together, each of the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens delivered by ST successfully induced an antigen-specific immune response, and it was also evident that an individual antigen strain can confer a considerable degree of protection.

In the absence of human anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine, animal vaccination is crucial, not only to protect animal health but also to stop zoonotic transmissions [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In an attempt to avoid non-ideal live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> organisms during vaccine preparation, we investigated the use of a highly attenuated rough <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (ST) vector to deliver <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens into a critical niche comparable to natural <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. In our previous study, we reported an evaluation of a cocktail of engineered <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> vectors delivering heterologous <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens. Briefly, the selected antigen includes lumazine synthase (BLS), proline racemase subunit A (PrpA), lipoprotein outer membrane protein-19 (Omp19), and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The BLS can induce a mixed Th1&#8211;Th2 pathway response, which accounts for humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while the PrpA has a potent stimulatory effect on splenocytes and B-cells, and that enzyme is also associated with chronic infection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. PrpA immunization can generate anti-PrpA antibodies in vaccinated animals, which, in turn, may attenuate the chronicity of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. The Omp19 elicits adaptive interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine production, which is necessary for mucosal immunity, and it also shows protective efficacy while used as a subunit or a DNA vaccine platform [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while the SOD is a protective antigen protein that is able to induce diverse immune responses [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This study investigated the immunostimulatory effects of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) combined with a live vaccine system. The complete <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>-based <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine (ST-rB) formulation consists of a combination of ST strains in conjunction with purified <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> LPS. It is important to determine whether any of the ST strains can be omitted from the combination without compromising the vaccine's protective efficacy. This information will allow formulation of a vaccine that is simpler and more economical to produce.</p><p>In this study, an engineered highly attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> vector was used for the purpose of vaccine antigen delivery. A rough ST strain designated JOL1800 (&#916;<italic toggle="yes">lon</italic>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">cpxR</italic>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">asd</italic>&#916;<italic toggle="yes">rfaL</italic>) was electroporated with plasmids harboring the gene of interest. Stable maintenance of the plasmid was mediated by auxotrophic mutation of the <italic toggle="yes">asd</italic> gene. The <italic toggle="yes">lon</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">cpxR</italic> genes are involved in bacterial physiology and associated with virulency. The <italic toggle="yes">waaL</italic> gene (formerly <italic toggle="yes">rfaL</italic>) is involved in the biosynthesis of O-antigen, and thus, mutation of that gene rendered the bacterial strain a rough phenotype [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the levels of protection conferred by those four individual <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigen-<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> strains in a mouse model. In addition, we determined whether each antigen is delivered successfully to the host by confirming the presence of antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). To ascertain the most effective route of immunization, mice were administered with the complete ST-rB LPS vaccine via oral, intramuscular (IM), intraperitoneal (IP), and subcutaneous (SC) routes. Protective efficacy of each route was determined upon virulent challenge of mice groups with wild-type <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> 544.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics and biosafety statement</title><p>All animal experimental procedures were approved (CBNU2015-00085) by the Chonbuk National University Animal Ethics Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Korean Council on Animal Care and Korean Animal Protection Law, 2007; Article 13 (Experiments with Animals).

The constructed vaccine candidate is described elsewhere [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Briefly, the open reading frames (ORF) of PrpA, Omp19, and SOD were amplified from the strain 544 genome by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then, inserted into the live vector pJHL65 via the incorporated <italic toggle="yes">EcoR</italic>I and <italic toggle="yes">Hind</italic>III restriction sites. The BLS gene cassette was synthesized <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> due to incompatibility in the restriction enzyme.

The plasmid was transferred to the BL21 <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> expression system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The expressing clones were induced with 1 mM IPTG at 0.6 optical density (OD) for 4 h. The culture was pelleted and subject to urea lysis and purification. The desired protein was purified by using a nickel-NTA column. The eluted purified protein was confirmed by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for purity and the protein concentration was ascertained by using the Bradford protein assay (Biorad, USA). The recombinant protein was used as the antigen for indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based detection of the delivered antigen-antibody response. Expression and purification of BLS and PrpA protein were described in our previous report [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. After 4 h of induction with IPTG at 37&#8451;, the conspicuous protein band corresponding to the desired protein was observed by performing Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE. The specific protein was further purified via histidine tag using a nickel-NTA column. The protein was further dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by using a dialysis membrane to remove excess urea.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunization, challenge, and protective efficacy</title><p>A total of ninety-six 5-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) female BALB/c mice were randomly assigned into 12 groups (n = 8 per group), fasted for 20 h, and injected with the constructed vaccine candidates according to the scheme presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. All mouse groups were challenged with 2 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/200 &#181;L of virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 544 at 30 days post-immunization via an IP route (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). At day 15 post-challenge, the spleen was isolated from the mice, and the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 544 splenic bacterial load was determined as previously described [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The live <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> vector used in this study is cleared within 14 days post-immunization, and hence, it does not need differentiation from challenge strain 544. The recovery time 50 (RT50), the time in weeks in which half of the pulsed mice are estimated as fully recovered from immunization in the spleen, obtained for RB51 was approximately 3.8 weeks and, as a precaution, rifampin was added in the recovery media in order to differentiate RB51 from strain 544. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> cell counts of each group were log<sub>10</sub> transformed and the protective index (PI) was calculated. PI is determined as the log<sub>10</sub> CFU count of the test vaccine subtracted from the log<sub>10</sub> CFU count of PBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Humoral immunity against whole-cell <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> lysate and specific BLS antigen</title><p>In order to confirm that an immune response was successfully generated against the delivered antigen, the specific antibody produced during immunization with individual ST-recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> strains was determined. Induction of antigen-specific antibodies in the cocktail of antigens was also assessed; for this experiment, the IP and oral routes of immunization were used. Serum samples were collected at weekly intervals for 4 weeks post-immunization. Briefly, 400 ng of purified <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigen/well were used to coat ELISA wells (Microlon; Greiner Bio-One, Germany). Primary mouse serum was diluted 1:50 with PBS, and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mice IgG antibodies were used at a 1:5,000 dilution. The colorimetric reaction was measured (TECAN, Austria) at 492 nm (620 nm reference) after 10 min of post-development. The values for the binding of IgG to the respective antigens were expressed as the mean OD value &#177; SE.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines</title><p>The influence of the route of administration of the cocktail vaccine on the selected cytokine levels was investigated. Relative cytokines levels were ascertained based on a protocol described previously with minor modifications [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice at 21 days post-immunization. Viable cells were placed in 24-well plates at a density of 2 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. After 24 h of incubation at 37&#8451; in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, the splenocytes were pulsed with sonicated whole-cell <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> 544 antigens (5 &#181;g/well), followed by incubation for 16 h. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) quantification was performed by using qPCR Master Mix (QuantiTect; Qiagen, Germany) to detect the levels of IL-17 and IL-23 cytokines. The reference gene &#946;-actin was used as an endogenous control. Fold changes for the cytokines were calculated as the mean value of 2<sup>&#8722;&#916;&#916;CT</sup> of a stimulated sample divided by the mean value of 2<sup>&#8722;&#916;&#916;CT</sup> of an unstimulated sample [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed where applicable.

Anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigen IgG production was detectable at the 1st week post-immunization among certain individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). At 3 weeks post-immunization, all individual vaccine deliveries induced significant differences in the immunized mice from those in the PBS and vector control groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8804; 0.05).

Overall, mouse groups immunized via oral or IP routes showed production of specific IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The maximum level of IgG production was observed against the Omp19 antigen. A significant increase in IgG production was observed as early as the 1st week post-immunization (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8804; 0.05). The fraction of anti-PrpA antibodies increased until the 4th week post-immunization (panel D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), while a declining pattern of IgG production was observed in the other groups.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 levels were determined for each mouse group (panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The IM and IP routes of immunization exhibited significant increases in IL-17 levels compared the level in PBS non-immunized mice. The level of another key mediator of inflammation, cytokine IL-23, was also determined (panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The SC immunization route produced increases in IL-23 levels; however, the change overlapped with that in the PBS control and the difference was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection efficacy of individual ST vaccine strain</title><p>The protective efficacy conferred by individual strains was determined in a mouse model. SPF-BALB/c mice (4 weeks old) were immunized with the constructed vaccine candidates and then injected with virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 at day 30 post-immunization. Mice were sacrificed at day 15 post-challenge. The relative difference in splenic weight was measured in each of the mouse groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Spleens of non-immunized mice were enlarged when compared to those in the vaccinated groups. However, there was no strong correlation between splenic weight and challenge protection, as the non-enlarged spleens also harbored considerable loads of challenge bacteria. The degree of challenge-bacteria burden in the target organ reflected the efficacy of immunization. In comparison with PBS results, all individual immunization strains, except the ST-PrpA strain, conferred significant levels of protection (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8804; 0.05; panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In the current experimental setting, maximum protection was conferred by the ST-SOD strain followed by that of LPS, ST-BLS, and ST-Omp. The protective indices were determined to be 0.51, 0.99, 0.22, 0.42, and 0.01 for LPS, ST-SOD, ST-Omp, ST-BLS, and ST-PrpA, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of route of immunization on protective efficacy of the combined LPS-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine</title><p>The influence of immunization routes was investigated. The lowest number of challenge strain CFUs was recovered from mice immunized via the IP route (panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This means the maximum level of protection was conferred to mice when the formulation was administered via the IP route. However, the difference between the IP and IM routes was not significant. In addition, the SC immunization route also conferred a range of protection similar to that of the IP and IM routes. The difference between SC and IM routes was not significant, but there was a significant difference between the SC and IP routes. Oral immunization produced the lowest level of protection among the compared routes; however, the level was significantly different from mice immunized via the IP route with vector only (control). Interestingly, the immunization with the combined LPS-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine via an IP or IM route produced significantly higher levels of protection than that from the inoculation with commercial strain RB51 vaccine via an IP route (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#8804; 0.005).

Immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate or vaccine lot-testing of <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 is usually carried out in a mouse model [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The level of protection index observed in this model is similar to those showed in bovine vaccination. However, testing of vaccine candidates in the final host may be necessary to prove the efficacy of the conserved proteins. In order to confirm the successful delivery of each antigen by the delivering vector, specific antibodies need to be evaluated. Also, the role of the humoral response in protection against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection should not be overlooked, although the replication niche of the pathogens is intracellular [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Complement killing and opsonization may also have an important role in reducing the bacterial load before the organism becomes intracellular [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, successful delivery of each antigen was confirmed by performing indirect ELISA. Among the candidate strains, the ST-Omp strain induced the highest level of IgG antibodies in mouse serum; counter-intuitively, the level of anti-PrpA antibodies was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The specific antibody production levels of the other tested strains were also determined. In the weeks following the immunization of the cocktail vaccine, the level of antibody production against each antigen was determined by using the appropriate recombinant protein. Antibody production against each antigen in this cocktail formulation was less than that from the individual strain vaccinations.</p><p>The effect of the combined <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine on the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-23 was also investigated. The IL-17 cytokine stimulates the generation of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, and IL-6, as well as inflammatory chemokines that facilitate the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. IL-17 also promotes expression of acute-phase response genes and antimicrobial substances. It is also implicated in host-resistance against fungal agents, such as <italic toggle="yes">Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Contradictory results have been observed in host resistance to brucellosis, in which it was demonstrated that Th-17 cells were dispensable for the control of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> infection in mice [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, IL-17 was implicated in protection against nasal infection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> bacteria via potentiation of interferon-&#947; [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we examined the relationship between route of administration of the RSrBL vaccine and subsequent IL-17 and IL-23 production. Mice immunized via the IM and IP routes showed significant increases in IL-17 production, whereas such increases were not observed following immunization via the oral and SC routes. The mechanism involved in producing these different results is unclear. The levels of IL-23 were also determined (panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). IL-23 has a pivotal role in maintaining the population of Th-17 cells, which are a novel T-cell subset involved in the antimicrobial immune response and the development of autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IL-23 activates STAT3, resulting in a direct binding of phosphorylated STAT3 to IL-17 or IL-17F promoters [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. No significant induction of the IL-23 cytokine upon <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigenic stimulation was observed.</p><p>As anticipated, we observed significant levels of protection when the vaccine strains are used singly. However, none of the single strains could surpass the immunization protection when the strains were used in combination. While it can be attributed to an inclusion of LPS in our previous study [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], in this study, we determined that a cocktail of vaccine strains without LPS could only confer protection in the range of 0.3 to 0.5. Moreover, the protection level was in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 when only LPS was used. In addition, the critical role of each protein in a natural infection was not tested in the current experimental setting. For instance, the PrpA protein was included to reduce the duration of chronicity. The shorter period of study, or even the mouse model used, may not provide an accurate representation of the disease in its chronic phase. Hence, whether any of the strain is dispensable from the final combination, may require further testing and trials.</p><p>In the comparison of the routes of administration, the IP route showed the highest level of protection. This advantage of the IP route may be attributed to the direct interaction with the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the bacterial vector. However, this route of immunization may be impractical for field deployment, as it requires a well-trained person for effective IP delivery, especially in a large animal host. Although the level of protection exhibited by mice immunized via the IM route was lower than that via the IP route, the difference was not significant. Immunization via the oral route produced the lowest levels of protection among the tested routes. This result may be attributed to the presence of degrading enzymes, low stomach pH, and the presence of food in the digestive tracts, which can reduce the effectiveness of processing by APCs. Hence, optimization of vaccine formulation may be necessary to improve the protective efficacy of an oral vaccine. For example, when administered via an oral route, the vaccine could be protected from the acidic pH of the stomach by using bicarbonate salts, or from enteric proteolytic enzymes by using and enteric-coating system.</p><p>Taken together, the present study revealed that a certain level of protection was conferred by selected individual vectored antigens, which indicates that ST-delivered <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens can successfully induce an antigen-specific immune response. It was also demonstrated that the efficacy of the vaccine candidate varied according to the route of administration. The IM route, which can reduce local inflammatory reactions, may be preferred to the SC or IP route due to its relative ease of administration. Although immunization via an oral administration showed an insufficient level of protection against the challenge, formulation improvements may be considered for application in human anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines; however, further study is needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health
