Reduced fertility rates and milk production are the most common symptoms of this disease in livestock. The most common transmission way of this infection to human is using contaminated products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Protective immunity against infection by Brucella spp. involves a cascade on immunity factors including the innate immunity, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, macrophages (M&#934;), dendritic cells (DCs) and inflammatory cytokines like IFN-&#947; and IFN &#945; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. So far live attenuated strains (e.g. Rev1) have been used to protect against the brucellosis but these vaccines cause abortion in pregnant animals. In addition, the current vaccines interfere in serological tests as well as are resistance to streptomycin and cause infection and disease in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Using recombinant vaccine as an inert vaccine offers advantages over whole organisms which not only can omit disadvantages of live vaccines but also introduce some advantages such as safety and purity. But these vaccines are not enough strong to stimulate strong immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] . Factors which should be considered in using inert vaccines are; selection an appropriate antigen and best adjuvant and also using a good delivery system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

It has been reported that, immunization of BALB/c mice with rOmp31 conferred a robust immunoglobulin G (IgG) response along with production the interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon, but not IL-10 or IL-4, which refers to induction T helper 1 (Th1) response and also a good CTL (Cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte) response which related to induce the CD8&#8201;+&#8201;T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Previous studies demonstrated that an exposed and hydrophobic loop of OMP31 antigen, located between 43 and 83 amino acid residuals, is conserved among the different strain of Brucella spp., and is cognate with mAb (A59/10F09/G10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

When the host encounters an antigen, evoking the immunity system is being done through the cellular mediated immunity procedures which act as an intracellular pathogen trapped inside the antigen-presenting cell (APCs) located in lymphoid organs.

As mentioned before, overcoming the level of IFN-&#947; in all experimental treatments (with the exception of negative control treatments that did not receive any recombinant protein or vaccine) and, in parallel, high levels of IL-2 emphasizes on the activation of cellular immunity and in particular, Th1 lymphocytes which aimed at the elimination of pathogens using the protective recombinant proteins.

As it can be traced in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the immune response in all experimental groups against the 3E and OMP31 proteins were similar to response against the Rev1 vaccine. This means that the sequence and structure of the OMP31 antigen and the 3E construct are exactly the same as the <italic toggle="yes">B.melitensis</italic> (Rev1vaccine) vaccine. Therefore, our recombinant proteins are well designed and immunologically bioactive. In this study, in addition to the potency, the efficacy of antigenic constructs was evaluated through the wright test and the microbial load count of the spleen. The results indicated that microbial load in the spleen of the mice receiving recombinant proteins were significantly low. So immunization of them were similar to that of mice received RevI vaccine, which implies to high immunoreaction of the memory cells after the challenge. Low microbial load in the spleen indicates a strong immune response as well as the polarization of the Th1 response against infection of the <italic toggle="yes">B.melitensis</italic>, which is associated with the removal of the intracellular pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

This means that, treating with the recombinant proteins (especially chimera proteins), directly involved cellular immunity through the activation of Th1 cells, and increased the level of IFN-&#947; secretion, one of the most important macrophage activation factors. Subsequently, activated macrophages (M1) initiate robust oxidative burst activity by phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) to increase the oxygen free radical (O2&#8722;) production and subsequently generating the H2O2, which is associated with the consumption of protons, or reacting with nitric oxide (NO) to create ONOO&#8722; that leads to killing of bacterial and the creation of an alkaline environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

In this regard, 1&#8201;&#956;g of rOMP31 antigen or r3E peptide or 1&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup>&#8201;CFU of Rev1 strain of <italic toggle="yes">B.melitensis</italic> were coated in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate and were incubated for 24&#8201;h in 4&#8201;&#176;C. Plats were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked for 1&#8201;h at 37&#8201;&#176;C with 5% skimmed milk in PBS. Then sera (supernatant of centrifuged blood in 3000&#8201;g for 20&#8201;min) were added serially in diluent buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 and were incubated for 2&#8201;h at room temperature, and were washed three times by PBS-T. 100&#8201;&#956;l of 1/10000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG&#8211;Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (containing Biotin which connect to coated antigens) antibody (Sigma, USA) was added to each well and plates were incubated for another 2&#8201;h at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Final washing was done in five times and then 100&#8201;&#956;l of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-tetramethyl-benzidine (TMB) substrate (which connect to HRP enzyme) was added to each well and plates were placed in the dark cabin (TMB is light sensitive) for 20&#8211;30&#8201;min. This reaction was stopped using 2&#8201;N H2SO4. Finally, color intensity was measured at OD 450&#8201;nm with an ELISA plate reader. Further evaluation was performed on IgG isotypes using 100&#8201;&#956;l of 1/50 dilution of sera using IgG1-HRP and IgG2a-HRP conjugated antibodies (Sigma, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Protection experiment</title><p id="Par53">Four&#8201;weeks after the last immunization, mice were challenges through intraperitoneal injection of 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>4</sup>&#8201;CFU of <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis M16</italic> per animal. Two weeks later, infected animals (five mice per treatment) were euthanized by cervical dislocation and their spleen were removed aseptically. Homogenized and lysed splenocyte (as described above) were serially diluted (1/10&#8211;1/10<sup>8</sup>). 100&#8201;&#956;l of each dilution was spread on Brucella Agar medium (HiMedia, USA) and incubated for 72&#8201;h in 37&#8201;&#176;C. CFU per spleen was calculated with direct counting of countable dishes from each dilution. Units of protection represented by mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;SD of log<sub>10</sub> CFU/spleens of treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Standard tube agglutination test</title><p id="Par54">Standard tube agglutination test (Wright) is used to confirm the presence of antibody against Brucella in infected or vaccinated animals. One month after the challenge, blood samples were taken from the remaining mice of each treatment (4 mice) and their blood serum were collected. After mixing the sera with the Brucella antigens, due to the specific reaction between the antigen and the antibody (agglutination), a sedimentation occurs at the bottom of the tube which is visible by naked eye. Serial dilution (1:20, 1:40 &#8230; 1:640) of sera (collected 2 weeks after challenge) was prepared using physiological saline (5.8&#8201;g NaCl and 5&#8201;g phenol dissolved in 1litr distilled water and autoclaved for 15&#8201;min in 120&#8201;&#176;C). Reading agglutination rate was performed after 20&#8201;h incubation at 37&#8201;&#176;C. If total antigens get agglutinated and the supernatant became clear, or 75% of antigens get agglutinated and the supernatant relatively became cloudy or 50% of antigens get agglutinated and the supernatant became relatively cloudy or 25% of antigens get agglutinated and the supernatant became cloudy the test result will be interpreted as +&#8201;4, +&#8201;3, +&#8201;2 and&#8201;+&#8201;1, respectively, While, no sedimentation and absolute cloudy soluble represents the negative answer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par55">Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean comparison of immune responses data was performed using Tukey&#8217;s test and SAS software.
