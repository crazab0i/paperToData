      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Brucellosis, sometimes called Malta fever, is a significant global zoonotic disease attributed to Gram-negative bacteria from the genus <italic>Brucella</italic> (Sadeghi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2022</xref>). Furthermore, the disease exhibits a substantial annual incidence rate, with over 500,000 new cases reported annually (Shirdast et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2021</xref>; Fatehi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2023</xref>). <italic>Brucella</italic> species, which include <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, <italic>B. abortus</italic>, <italic>B. suis</italic>, <italic>B. canis</italic>, <italic>B. ovis</italic>, and <italic>B. neotomae</italic>, are facultative intracellular bacteria capable of establishing persistent infections within host cells, thus often complicating the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases (Hou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). Live attenuated vaccines (namely <italic>B. melitensis</italic> Rev1 and <italic>B. abortus</italic> RB51) are used for animal immunization as a preventive measure against <italic>Brucella</italic> infection, owing to their significant economic ramifications and medical burden (Hou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). The use of live-attenuated vaccinations, despite their influential role in the control of brucellosis in animals, presents some drawbacks, including the excretion of bacteria in milk, potential risks to human health, induction of miscarriage in pregnant animals, and the possible reversion of the attenuated organism to a virulent state. Given these constraints, there remains a constant need to create immunizations displaying high efficacy and safety (Heidary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>; Darbandi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par3">Infections might potentially arise after ingesting or inhaling <italic>Brucellae</italic>, which can penetrate mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa, via lymphoid cells (Olsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR500">2022</xref>). Infections may arise after ingesting or inhaling <italic>Brucellae</italic>, which can infiltrate mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa, via lymphoid cells. After being engulfed by macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), it has been shown that about 40&#x2013;50% of the bacteria exhibit resistance to intracellular digestion (L&#xF3;pez-Santiago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>). Given that the mucosal surfaces serve as the primary points of entry for <italic>Brucella</italic> into the human body, it becomes logical to consider the development of a vaccine for brucellosis that may be delivered through the mucosal route (Bialer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par4">Mucosal surfaces, such as the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts, are the primary contact points and entrances for many pathogens. Consequently, establishing protective immunity at these mucosal surfaces is often desirable in the realm of novel vaccine development. At present, approved vaccinations for humans or animals are often provided through the parenteral route. However, it is essential to note that vaccines administered via this route usually do not effectively stimulate mucosal immune responses (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>). In contrast, mucosal-administered vaccines have the potential capacity to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses at mucosal locations as well as at the systemic level. The combination of mucosal vaccines&#x2019; characteristics and their needleless, noninvasive immunization technique makes them an appealing option for vaccination (Skwarczynski and Toth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par5">There is a growing emphasis on the use of mucosal administration and probiotic-based systems due to the potential of <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<italic>L. lactis</italic>) to serve as a live vector for expressing viral and bacterial proteins (Diaz-Dinamarca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic> is classified as a Gram-positive microorganism characterized by its non-pathogenic and non-invasive nature. It is a member of the <italic>lactic acid bacterium (LAB)</italic> group. Moreover, this organism is commonly recognized as safe (GRAS). Viral, bacterial, and parasite antigens have been successfully produced in <italic>L. lactis</italic>, a bacterium often used in research. These recombinant strains have shown the ability to effectively transfer antigens to the intestines&#x2019; mucosal areas, eliciting a targeted immune response (Gouran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2023</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown evidence that <italic>L. lactis</italic> can endure transit through the gastrointestinal system in both animal models and human subjects without establishing colonization (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). This characteristic makes <italic>L. lactis</italic> a promising contender for developing vaccines for human use. The use of <italic>L. lactis</italic> for immunization offers many benefits owing to the adjuvant qualities of its peptidoglycan wall. Additionally, <italic>L. lactis</italic> may serve as a protein expression system, guaranteeing the production of the antigen (Qiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). Within this particular framework, the use of <italic>Omp10</italic> as an antigen within a strain of <italic>L. lactis</italic> has the potential to function as a vehicle for the delivery of antigens, hence facilitating the creation of an ingestible vaccine. This research aimed to assess the potential of <italic>L. lactis</italic> strains that express <italic>Omp10</italic> to induce a protective humoral and cellular immune response against <italic>Brucella</italic> colonization in a mouse model.</p>

        <p id="Par6">This study obtained <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) Top 10F and <italic>L. lactis</italic> PTCC1336 from the Iran Biological Resources Center. The <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria were cultured in M17 broth (DM565) (Quelab, Canada). The bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> strain Top 10F was cultured in LB broth (Merck, Germany) at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C and a shaking speed of 200&#xA0;rpm using a shaker incubator. Agar media on the plates were prepared by adding Merck&#x2019;s microbiological agar medium at a concentration of 1.5%. The <italic>B. abortus</italic> strain 2308 was cultivated in <italic>Brucella</italic> Agar (Himedia, India) with horse serum. The cultivation process was carried out at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C in an environment containing 10% carbon dioxide for 72&#xA0;h, without any agitation. Brucellosis vaccine IRIBA (IRIBA Vac) was prepared as a positive control. GENEray (GENEray, China) supplied the pNZ8148 <italic>Lactococcus</italic> expression vector.</p>

        <title>Synthesis of recombinant <italic>L. lactis</italic></title>
        <p id="Par7">The plasmid vector pNZ8148 was synthesized by GENEray company (GENEray, China). The researchers used the Addgene website as a resource to collect information about the nisin-based expression vector pNZ8148. Additionally, the software tool Gene Runner was employed to facilitate the selection of appropriate restriction enzyme cleavage sites. The expression vector pNZ8148 (T) includes several components, notably an origin of replication (ORI), a gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance, two genes encoding replication proteins repA and repC, a nisin-inducible promoter (P nisA), and a transcription terminator. This vector was designed to facilitate the expression of cloned sequences in Gram-positive bacteria, especially LAB. The final construct was synthesized by combining a 381&#xA0;bp <italic>Omp10</italic> gene fragment, identified as accession number L27995.1, with a 27 amino acid signal peptide sequence named Usp45, associated with accession code ABY84357. The proteins&#x2019; immunogenicity and 3D structure were assessed using Vaxijen and SWISS-MODEL. The CELLO program, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/">http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/</ext-link>, was used to ascertain the specific subcellular localization of protein inside the <italic>B. abortus</italic> bacterium. The gene and the signal peptide (Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic>) were synthetically cloned into the nisin-based vector pNZ8148, specifically between the <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I cutting sites (Bohlul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>).</p>

      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Verification of <italic>Omp10</italic> cloning in pNZ8148 vector</title>
        <p id="Par8">The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to observe the presence of <italic>Omp10</italic> by using primers (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) that specifically target this gene. Furthermore, the cloning process&#x2019;s precision was confirmed by using enzymatic digestion and sequencing techniques (Rezaei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). The PCR process consists of a 2&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10&#xA0;mL PCR buffer (amplicons, Denmark), 2&#xA0;mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200&#xA0;&#x3BC;M of dNTPs (Yekta Tajhiz Azma, Iran), 10&#xA0;pmol of each primer (metabion, Germany), 100&#xA0;ng of plasmid DNA, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme (Tajhiz Azma, Iran). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) temperature protocol comprises an initial annealing phase at 95&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;min. This is then followed by a series of 30 repeating cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min, annealing at 52&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min, and extension at 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min. The ultimate elongation was ultimately executed at a temperature of 72&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;min. The PCR product was evaluated using 1% gel electrophoresis. Enzymatic digestion using <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I restriction enzymes and determining the nucleotide sequence of the recombinant vector was performed by GENEray.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The primers used in the present investigation were specifically developed for this research</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Gene</th><th align="left">Sequence (5&#x2032;&#x2009;&#x2192;&#x2009;3&#x2032;)</th><th align="left">TM (&#x2103;)</th><th align="left">Size (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>omp10</italic></td><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-ATGGAAAGTATGGATATGAAAAG-3&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">57</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">381</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R: 5&#x2032;-TTAACCAGCATTACGACGTGTT-3&#x2032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>GAPDH</italic></td><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">60</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">78</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R: 5&#x2032;-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3&#x2032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>IFN-&#x3B3;</italic></td><td align="left">F:5&#x2032;-AGCGGCTGACTGAACTCAGATTGTAG-3&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">60</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">199</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-GTCACAGTTTTCAGCTGTATAGGG-3&#x2032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>IL-10</italic></td><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-CTTGGGACTGATGCTGGTGAC-3&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">60</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">162</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R: 5&#x2032;-TCTTTTCTCATTTCCACGATTTC-3&#x2032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>IL-4</italic></td><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-CGAAGAACACCACAGAGAGTGAGCT-3&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">60</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">180</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R: 5&#x2032;-GACTCATTCATGGTGCAGCTTATCG-3&#x2032;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><italic>TNF-&#x3B1;</italic></td><td align="left">F: 5&#x2032;-AGGCACTCCCCCAAAAGATG&#x2032;</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">60</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="2">183</td></tr><tr><td align="left">R: 5&#x2032;-CCACTTGGTGGTTTGTGAGTG-3&#x2032;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

        <title>Transformation, SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Assay</title>
        <p id="Par9">The <italic>L. lactis</italic> strain was effectively transformed with the recombinant plasmid pNZ8148-Omp10-Usp45 using the electroporation method using a Gene Pulser (Xcell BIO-RAD Gene Pulser; with 2500&#xA0;V, 25&#xA0;&#xB5;F, and 200&#xA0;&#x3A9;). In this experiment, an electroporator introduced genetic material into <italic>L. lactis</italic> host cells. Specifically, 400&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of the host cells were transfected with 6&#xA0;&#x3BC;L (0.2&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/&#x3BC;L) of the recombinant plasmid pNZ8148-Usp45, which carries the <italic>Omp10</italic> gene. Additionally, 6&#xA0;&#x3BC;L (0.2&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/&#x3BC;L) of the pNZ8148 vector without the <italic>Omp10</italic> gene was also transfected into the cells as a negative control. A suspension of <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria was grown on M17 Agar with 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/mL chloramphenicol. The chloramphenicol-resistant gene in the pNZ8148 plasmid was used as a selection marker to identify the successfully transformed <italic>L. lactis</italic>/pNZ8148-<italic>Omp10</italic>-Usp45 strain (Soumya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2023</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par10">The recombinant <italic>L. lactis</italic> strain comprised pNZ814-Omp10-Usp45 and was cultured on an M17 medium. The media was supplemented with 0.5% glucose, and 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/mL chloramphenicol was added. The recombinant strains were cultured and then induced with a 10&#xA0;ng/mL nisin concentration until the bacteria reached an optical density of about 0.5 at a OD<sub>600</sub>. The supernatant was collected using centrifugation at 10,000 RPM at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 30&#xA0;min. The resulting bacterial protein supernatants were concentrated 50-fold compared to their initial volume by the salting out method. Subsequently, the concentrated supernatants were analyzed using 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Transferring protein from a gel to a nitrocellulose membrane was conducted, followed by blocking the membrane using a 3% BSA solution. This blocking step included incubating the membrane at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;h. Following the washing step with washing buffer (PBS/T), the membrane was incubated with Anti-his antibody (HRP conjugated-Rozhan AZMA, Inc., Iran) at a dilution of 1/1000 in PBS. The washing processes were repeated after incubation (1&#xA0;h, 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C). Ultimately, the membrane was subjected to development using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par26">The prevalence of brucellosis in the Middle East and its significant economic impact on the cattle business necessitates the rigorous recommendation of vaccination as a preventive measure against this disease (Dorneles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). Novel vaccination approaches that prioritize the establishment of robust immune responses, reduction of adverse effects, safe handling procedures, uncomplicated administration, and cost-effective production and distribution have the potential to address safety concerns and mitigate the drawbacks associated with the current utilization of live attenuated <italic>Brucella</italic> strains for brucellosis control (Hou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>). The efficacy of vaccination strategies lies in identifying and using novel immunogenic antigens of <italic>Brucella</italic>, which may be employed in the manufacture of recombinant vaccines. Limited studies have been conducted on the use of <italic>E. coli</italic> for the production of a recombinant vaccine aimed at preventing brucellosis (Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). Many researchers have regarded live vector vaccination systems using probiotics as a proficient method for delivering antigens. The LAB has been widely used as a reliable model in several research investigations (Qiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic>, a Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) Gram-positive LAB, has been used to manufacture food for thousands of years (Levit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>). Today, however, it serves as a cell factory for creating heterologous proteins for medicinal and commercial applications, providing a novel and exciting option for the manufacture of proteins at an industrial scale (Levit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>). The primary objective of this work is to demonstrate <italic>L. lactis</italic> as a viable option for developing safe and non-pathogenic mucosal live vaccines. Additionally, the study aims to explore the potential of producing the immunogenic <italic>Omp10</italic> protein as an alternative machinery system to <italic>E. coli</italic>, considering its advantageous characteristics. In this study, the <italic>Omp10</italic> gene fragment with a length of 381&#xA0;bp, along with Usp45, the signal peptide was cloned in pNZ8148 vector by <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xba</italic>I restriction enzymes. This is the first study to investigate the cloning, production, and purification of a fusion protein, including <italic>Omp10</italic> and Usp45. The results obtained from PCR, enzyme digestion, and sequencing indicated the successful cloning of <italic>Omp10</italic>-Usp45 in the pNZ8148 vector. Using Western blotting and SDS-PAGE analysis, we demonstrated that <italic>L. lactis efficiently secreted Omp10</italic>.</p>
      <p id="Par27">To ensure its intracellular survival, <italic>Brucella</italic> has developed many strategies to evade host detection and successfully establish infection. After bacteremia, <italic>Brucella</italic> specifically targets macrophages as one of the primary cells to maintain condition. After establishing intracellular infection, <italic>brucellae</italic> exhibit enhanced resistance to removal due to their possession of many mechanisms that enable evasion of the host immune system (Pascual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>). Therefore, it can be seen that <italic>brucellae</italic> are present inside vacuoles that contain <italic>Brucella</italic> (Pascual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>). The presence of cellular immunity is crucial in providing defense against brucellosis. The eradication of <italic>brucellae</italic> necessitates an inflammatory or T helper (Th)1 cell response, contingent upon the presence of IL-12 and TNF-&#x3B1;, and is responsible for the induction of IFN-&#x3B3; (Yingst and Hoover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2003</xref>). Brucellosis exhibits systemic dissemination irrespective of the mode of exposure. One notable benefit of mucosal vaccination is its ability to provide localized protection to the mucosal surfaces near infection sites, hence inducing the activation of memory T cells that effectively hinder subsequent reinfection (Pascual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>). In addition to eliciting a response from the mucosal immune system, mucosal vaccination also leads to the development of systemic immunity (Pascual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>). One significant benefit of mucosal vaccination is its ability to provide protective immunity in both mucosal and systemic organs. Indeed, the acquisition of <italic>Brucella</italic> infection occurs due to mucosal exposure. Currently, immunization is a very successful strategy for preventing and managing animal brucellosis (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>). When administered to animals, the optimal vaccine for brucellosis should possess avirulent or attenuated characteristics, effectively preventing <italic>Brucella</italic> infections. Simultaneously, it should not impede the accuracy of serological diagnostic methods (Heidary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). Furthermore, the intervention must have the capability to effectively inhibit abortion and virulence reversal while concurrently facilitating extended durations of immune protection (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>). Nevertheless, contemporary vaccinations have significant drawbacks that restrict their use, notwithstanding their efficacy in averting animal infections. Hence, the endeavor to create a vaccination that is both safe and productive is a challenging undertaking. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are a subset of surface antigens found in <italic>Brucella</italic> (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>; Heidary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). One may argue that oligomeric membrane proteins (OMPs) possess favorable attributes that provide viable options for producing recombinant proteins intended for both preventive and diagnostic purposes (Heidary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). These attributes include their safeguarded sequences, antigenic properties, and elevated pathogenicity levels. OMPs have been shown to have a significant role in activating both cellular and humoral immunity (Ducrotoy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>). These proteins have been identified as crucial antigens with protective properties and the capacity to induce an immune response. Our study successfully showed that the administration of live <italic>L. lactis</italic> expressing <italic>Omp10</italic> by oral vaccination in mice resulted in a noteworthy increase in the production of <italic>Omp10</italic>-specific mucosal IgA antibodies. Villena et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>) conducted a study whereby <italic>rL. lactis</italic> was used as a vehicle for the presentation of pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA). Immunological investigations have further shown that the oral administration of the vaccine led to a significant increase in serum and mucosal IgA (Villena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Our research also found that the IgA level in fecal pellets of mice immunized with live <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA vaccine was much higher than that of the control group. Our findings were consistent with those of two earlier investigations that used <italic>rL. lactis</italic> as a delivery method for SOD and L7/L12 antigens from <italic>B. abortus</italic> and found similar levels of antigen-specific IgA production (S&#xE1;ez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>; Pontes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par28">During <italic>Brucella</italic> infection, the host&#x2019;s immune response includes both cellular and humoral immunity (Perkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). The generation of IgG2a antibodies distinguishes the former condition, whereas the latter condition is determined by the generation of IgG1 antibodies. The involvement of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the phagocytic elimination of <italic>Brucella</italic> by macrophages is important (Perkins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). BALB/c mice were vaccinated with several agents, including PBS, <italic>L. lactis</italic>, pNZ8148, <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148, and <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic>, to investigate the effect on humoral immunity. Mice serum was collected at 0, 4, 7, 14, and 28&#xA0;days post-immunization. The results showed a significant increase in total IgG and IgG1 antibody titers on days 14 and 28 after vaccination with <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA vaccine, While the titer of antibodies in other groups did not show a significant increase. In addition, the level of cytokines IFN-&#x3B3;, TNF-&#x3B1;, IL10, and IL-4 as markers of cellular immunity was investigated by ELISA and qPCR. IFN-&#x3B3; can induce Th1 cell differentiation, resulting in the generation of IgG2a antibodies by activated plasma cells. IFN-&#x3B3; is necessary for the expression of macrophage bactericidal activity, as it stimulates the activation of macrophages, resulting in an increased ability to eliminate bacteria and suppress microbial proliferation (Priyanka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>). IFN-&#x3B3; assumes a crucial function in eliminating intracellular <italic>Brucella</italic> pathogens in the first phases of infection (Priyanka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021</xref>). In the current investigation, it was shown that the expression of IFN-&#x3B3; was significantly elevated in mice vaccinated with <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA vaccine on both day 14 and day 28, as compared to the control group. TNF-&#x3B1; is recognized as a crucial mediator in the immune response of macrophages against <italic>Brucella</italic> infection. TNF-&#x3B1; plays a crucial role in facilitating the recruitment of phagocytes to the site of infection and activating macrophages (Sa&#x11F;mak Tartar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). Additionally, TNF-&#x3B1; is of utmost significance in orchestrating immune responses against intracellular infections (Sa&#x11F;mak Tartar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). This study&#x2019;s findings indicate an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x3B1;, in both the <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA groups. In contrast, the cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 can suppress the activity of macrophages, enhancing the host&#x2019;s resistance to <italic>Brucella</italic> infection. The findings of the current research indicate that mice inoculated with <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIB exhibited reduced levels of IL-10 and IL-14 production in comparison to the control group, namely on days 7 and 14 post-vaccination.</p>
      <p id="Par29">The optimal vaccination should induce more protection even in the absence of virulence for the host. We discovered that <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA vaccines protect against <italic>B. abortus</italic> in BALB/c. The administration of pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> resulted in a notable degree of immunity compared to the control groups receiving PBS and the free vector. This investigation showed that the live-attenuated vaccine (IRIBA) protected significantly against <italic>Brucella</italic> infection. However, it is worth noting that the difference in protection between mice inoculated with <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> and IRIBA was not statistically significant. In the present case, a noteworthy decrease in bacterial load has been seen in the mice administered with <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic>, indicating that a live vector vaccine can potentially mitigate bacterial colonization. Previous studies have elucidated the inherent characteristics of live vector vaccines in inducing a specific immune response against antigens associated with various illnesses (Diaz-Dinamarca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Gouran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2023</xref>). The results of this study indicate that the use of <italic>L. lactis</italic>-pNZ8148-Usp45-<italic>Omp10</italic> as a means of expressing vectors has the potential to provide cost-effective, easily administered, and efficacious live oral vaccines for the prevention of <italic>B. abortus</italic> infection. Serum antibodies are paramount in protecting mucosal surfaces due to their opsonophagocytic activity. As a result, our study offers a novel method for using the food-grade, nonpathogenic, and noncommercial bacterium <italic>L. lactis</italic> as a protein cell factory to produce the novel immunogenic fusion candidate r<italic>Omp10</italic>. This method offers an appealing new approach to assessing the cost-effective, safe, sustainable, simple pilot development of pharmaceutical products. It suggests a workable method for delivering additional heterologous protein antigens. We have already started doing further studies in our labs, such as testing the immunogenicity and protective effectiveness of this recombinant <italic>L. lactis</italic>-r<italic>Omp10</italic> strain as a potential oral vaccine candidate versus virulent <italic>Brucella</italic> infection challenge in mice. This study constructed a live <italic>L. lactis</italic> vaccine expressing <italic>omp10</italic>, which was effective as an oral vaccine in BALB/C mice. The recombinant strain vaccine induced both humoral and cellular responses and improved the immune system compared to the control groups.</p>
