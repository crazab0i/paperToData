A community cross-sectional survey was carried out in a rural setting of northwest Iran between February and May 2023. Rural individuals were interviewed according to a questionnaire with questions about demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to human brucellosis. We employed descriptive statistics to study knowledge, attitudes, and practice patterns. In addition, we applied a multivariable logistic regression model to assess potential predictors of knowledge, attitudes, and practice related to brucellosis using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Among 700 participants, 91.1% were aware of brucellosis, and 85.7% identified cows, sheep, and goats as primary transmission sources. 75.6% and 78.7% recognized transmission risks via unpasteurized and raw milk products. 60.5% understood the benefits of boiling milk and using gloves. Attitudinally, 64.3% perceived higher risk for livestock owners and supported practices like milk pasteurization (70.5%), protective gear (84.4%), handwashing (92.2%), and animal vaccination (71.0%). 90% expressed a need for more information. In practice, 44.8% exclusively consumed boiled and pasteurized milk, 37.8% consumed fresh cheese, and 92.2% solely consumed thoroughly cooked animal meat. Logistic regression revealed that higher education and no prior history of the disease correlated with good knowledge and attitudes, while older participants displayed inappropriate practices compared to their younger counterparts. This study highlights the reasonably high awareness of brucellosis, particularly regarding transmission sources and preventive measures. However, the gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices still exist, with education level emerging as a significant factor. To improve prevention practices, tailored interventions addressing age-related disparities are necessary.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Brucellosis</kwd><kwd>Developing countries</kwd><kwd>Neglected tropical diseases</kwd><kwd>Iran</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0010">Brucellosis, caused by Gram-negative coccobacillus bacteria hailing from the Brucella genus, wields a substantial global influence by afflicting both livestock and human populations, ultimately leaving a profound mark on their respective economic sectors worldwide [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In animals, the disease is highly contagious and can cross species, primarily transmitted through mucosal contact with aborted fetuses and fetal membranes containing significant bacterial loads [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Infected livestock suffer economically significant clinical symptoms, including reduced fertility, abortions, and a substantial decline in milk production, impacting stakeholders such as small-scale livestock farmers and the meat and milk industry [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Humans are regarded as accidental hosts, susceptible to infection through contact with animals and their byproducts. In humans, brucellosis presents with non-specific clinical signs such as malaise, fatigue, arthritis, and fever, often leading to chronicity and recurring febrile conditions with joint pain [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This results in significant loss of work days and socioeconomic disparities among infected individuals and their families. Additionally, human-to-human transmission can occur through various means, including transplacentally, via breastfeeding, and rarely through sexual intercourse, organ transplantation, and blood transfusions [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Direct contact with infected animals, their tissues, or products, including dairy, can also lead to transmission [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
      <p id="p0015">Due to its disproportionate impact on low-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has categorized it as one of the prominent 'neglected zoonotic diseases' worldwide. These countries share common developmental, cultural, and sometimes geohistorical characteristics that contribute to the persistence of the disease [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Traditional practices, such as the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products and the prevalence of pastoralism, serve as pathways for transmitting the disease from animals to humans [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of social and political instability, coupled with limited financial and human resources, hinders the development and sustained implementation of disease control programs, despite significant progress made over the years in combating the disease in various parts of the world.</p>
      <p id="p0020">For an efficient control program to be implemented successfully, it is crucial to possess a thorough understanding of the local community's knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning brucellosis [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Such insights serve as the foundation for tailoring information delivery strategies that are culturally and contextually relevant. Moreover, this understanding is instrumental in formulating and executing targeted control measures that can effectively mitigate the transmission and impact of brucellosis within the specific community [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By bridging the gap between public health interventions and the local population's perceptions and behaviors, we can enhance the likelihood of successful control efforts and ultimately reduce the burden of brucellosis in the area.</p>
      <p id="p0025">Previous studies have delved into the multifaceted aspects of brucellosis awareness and practices, revealing distinctive patterns across diverse populations. In a cross-sectional study conducted in Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a stark revelation emerged as only half of the participants were acquainted with brucellosis. Nonetheless, 70% of those aware demonstrated commendable knowledge, particularly among males, healthcare workers, and those with higher education. In Jordan [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a comprehensive evaluation of livestock owners' knowledge, attitudes, and practices demonstrated universal awareness (100%), but significant knowledge gaps persisted, particularly regarding direct transmission routes. High-risk practices, such as aiding in animal parturition (62%), were prevalent, reflecting a potential public health risk. Meanwhile, the study in southwestern Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] focused on parents, revealing that 90% exhibited good knowledge and satisfactory attitudes and practices. These collective insights illuminate the varied landscape of brucellosis awareness globally, prompting the need for context-specific interventions.</p>
      <p id="p0030">The primary aim of this study was to assess and delineate areas of deficiency in knowledge, attitudes, and practices about brucellosis among the rural population within a low-income Middle Eastern nation. This knowledge is pivotal for the formulation of prospective control initiatives and public health interventions.</p>

        <title>Study setting</title>
        <p id="p0040">This province accommodates an estimated population of 1,270,000 inhabitants, with around 400,000 residing in rural areas. In these areas, there exists a notable cohabitation of high human population density and cattle. This region in Iran is renowned for its prominence in the livestock industry. Ardabil Province is home to more than 3.9 million livestock units, ranking it among the top ten provinces nationally in the field of animal husbandry. The province boasts a livestock population of over 2 million small ruminants and 350,000 large ruminants. The prevalence of brucellosis in Ardabil Province is reported to be three times higher than the national average [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> depicts the province of Ardabil in northwest Iran, highlighting the specific rural areas surveyed during the study.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Geographic location of the study.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

          <title>Study population and sampling process</title>
          <p id="p0045">The study population for this research comprises rural residents across all counties in the province. We utilized a "stratified random sampling" approach for sampling. Villages with the highest reported brucellosis cases were identified based on data from county health authorities. From each county, 3 to 5 villages were chosen (depending on their population). In these selected villages, a list of all households was compiled. Random sampling was used to select specific households, and the survey was conducted during in-person visits to ensure a structured and representative sample. To be eligible for participation in this study, individuals were required to be rural residents in the designated province for at least one year. Moreover, willingness to participate in the study was a crucial criterion for eligibility. For illiterate participants, survey items were clarified by the interviewers to ensure a complete understanding of the questions. The presence of physical, cognitive, or psychological impairments that could impact survey participation was considered among the criteria for exclusion from the study. To determine the sample size, e formula <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo linebreak="goodbreak" linebreakstyle="after">=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x2212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is applied, where <italic>n</italic> represents the required sample size, <italic>Z</italic> signifies the standard deviation corresponding to the chosen significance level (1.96 for a 95% confidence level), <italic>p</italic> stands for the proportion of the population under consideration (in this case and according to other similar studies, 0.15), and <italic>d</italic> indicates the margin of error (0.2 for our case). When these values are plugged into the formula, it yields a base sample size of 550 individuals. However, this initial calculation doesn't consider the design effect, which takes into account the potential influence of the study design. In this case, adjusting for the design effect results in a final sample size of 700 participants. This larger sample size helps ensure that the study has adequate statistical power to draw reliable conclusions regarding brucellosis awareness, attitudes, and practices among the target population.</p>

        <title>Measurement</title>
        <p id="p0050">The questionnaire used in this study was divided into three distinct sections. The first section encompassed demographic information, where participants provided data about their age, gender, education, and other relevant background characteristics. The second section delved into participants' medical history, specifically their previous exposure or diagnosis of brucellosis. The final section, and the focus of our analysis, revolved around the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding brucellosis.</p>
        <p id="p0055">Since there was no pre-existing tool available for data collection in Iran, we designed an instrument based on existing questionnaires utilized in other developing countries. The process of designing the questionnaire involved several meticulous steps [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. First, a comprehensive review of existing questionnaires and surveys used in developing countries, particularly in regions with a high prevalence of brucellosis, was conducted to identify relevant items. Next, a panel of experts, including epidemiologists and public health specialists, assessed the suitability of these items for the local context in Iran. After refining and adapting the questions, a pilot study was conducted among a sample of individuals from the target population to assess the clarity, comprehensibility, and relevance of the questionnaire. Based on the feedback and results of the pilot study, necessary adjustments were made to ensure that the questions were culturally and contextually appropriate. Finally, the questionnaire was administered to the study population, and the collected data were rigorously analyzed to ensure the reliability and validity of the newly developed scale. This meticulous process aimed to create a tool that effectively measured the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the local population regarding brucellosis in Iran.For this main section, we employed a comprehensive multi-item questionnaire to assess participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding brucellosis. For knowledge assessment, questions covered aspects like disease awareness, transmission sources, routes, and preventive practices. In the attitudes section, participants were asked about their beliefs concerning risk factors, the importance of pasteurization, the necessity of protective gear, and vaccination. The practice section of the questionnaire focused on actual behaviors, such as the consumption of specific dairy products and the cooking of animal meat (original and translated versions are available in supplementary file).</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p id="p0060">The questionnaire data were inputted into Microsoft Excel, and subsequent statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 17.0. We employed descriptive statistics to describe demographic characteristics and assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices on brucellosis. To explore potential predictors of KAP items about brucellosis (e.g., whether the farmer had heard about the disease), logistic regression analyses were employed [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Based on percentiles, overall knowledge, attitudes, and practice of brucellosis were categorized into low and high groups using the 75th percentile as cut off. A score equivalent to or higher than the 75th percentile in each category (knowledge, attitude, and practice) was classified as a good knowledge/attitude/practice towards brucellosis, and lower scores indicated a poor condition. The examined explanatory variables included age group, gender, level of education, livestock ownership, and a history of brucellosis among participants and their families. Variables demonstrating a P-value &lt;0.2 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model, and manual backward elimination was conducted until all remaining variables exhibited a P-value &#x2264;0.05. The statistical significance level was defined as a two-tailed P-value &#x2264;0.05.</p>

        <p id="p0070">The percentage of participants with correct knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward brucellosis is presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Out of the 700 participants, 638 individuals (91.1%) reported being aware of a condition referred to as "brucellosis&#x201D;. A total of 600 participants (85.7%) held the belief that animals could transmit the disease. Concerning animals through which the disease could potentially be transmitted, 572 (81.8%) participants thought that cows, sheep, and goats were primary sources. Regarding potential routes of transmission, 529 participants (75.6%) and 551 participants (78.7%) correctly believed brucellosis is transmissible through consuming unpasteurized milk products and drinking raw milk from infected animals., respectively. 423 participants (60.5%) exhibited awareness that boiling milk and wearing gloves when handling animals can effectively prevent the onset of the disease. In the bivariable analysis, education level and having a history of brucellosis showed potential association with the outcome knowledge about brucellosis. Under multivariable analysis, these two variables indicated a significant association with knowledge about brucellosis. Participants whose education level was high school or higher were 1.6 times more likely to have good knowledge of brucellosis than their illiterate counterparts [AOR&#xA0;=&#xA0;1.6, 95% CI: (1.0&#x2013;2.5)]. On the other hand, participants with a previous history of brucellosis were 2.6 times more likely to have good knowledge of the disease [AOR&#xA0;=&#xA0;2.6, 95% CI: (1.7&#x2013;4.1)] (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding brucellosis.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Knowledge, attitudes, and practice towards brucellosis based on available variables, rural Ardabil, Iran, 2023.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Variables</th><th>Participants with good knowledge, n (%)</th><th>Participants with good attitude, n (%)</th><th>Participants with good practice, n (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">sex</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="left">211 (64.3)</td><td align="left">192 (58.5)</td><td align="left">158 (48.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Male</td><td align="left">252 (67.7)</td><td align="left">239 (64.2)</td><td align="left">198 (53.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">Age (years)</td><td align="left">20&#x2013;50</td><td align="left">333 (65.6)</td><td align="left">331 (65.2)</td><td align="left">275 (54.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&gt;50</td><td align="left">130 (67.3)</td><td align="left">100 (51.8)</td><td align="left">81 (42.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" align="left">education</td><td align="left">Illiterate</td><td align="left">69 (56.1)</td><td align="left">52 (42.2)</td><td align="left">56 (45.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">High-school</td><td align="left">179 (67.9)</td><td align="left">158 (60.7)</td><td align="left">130 (50.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Higher-education</td><td align="left">215 (67.8)</td><td align="left">221 (69.7)</td><td align="left">170 (53.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">Livestock owner</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">211 (65.7)</td><td align="left">182 (56.6)</td><td align="left">165 (51.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">252 (66.5)</td><td align="left">249 (65.6)</td><td align="left">191 (50.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">Brucellosis history</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">46 (45.5)</td><td align="left">46 (45.5)</td><td align="left">48 (47.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">417 (69.6)</td><td align="left">385 (64.2)</td><td align="left">308 (51.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">Family history of brucellosis</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">92 (65.2)</td><td align="left">73 (51.7)</td><td align="left">76 (53.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">no</td><td align="left">371 (66.3)</td><td align="left">358 (59.7)</td><td align="left">280 (50.0)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

          <p id="p0075">Among a total of 450 participants (64.3%), it was perceived that livestock owners and their families were at a higher risk of contracting brucellosis. The necessity of milk pasteurization before cheese production was endorsed by 494 participants (70.5%) in our study. 591 (84.4%) participants shared the belief that using protective gloves or masks is necessary when milking, assisting during animal births and abortions, or handling placentas and aborted fetuses. 644 participants (92.2%) deemed handwashing after animal handling to be essential. 500 participants (71.0%) regarded animal vaccination as a necessity to prevent brucellosis. Ninety percent (n&#xA0;=&#xA0;632) of the participants reported that they needed more information about brucellosis. In the bivariate analysis, it was observed that gender, education level, owning livestock, and a prior history of brucellosis displayed potential associations with the outcome variable, namely attitudes about brucellosis. In the multivariable logistic regression, however, it was found that gender, owning livestock, and family history of brucellosis did not have a statistically significant impact on the outcome variable. However, the odds of good attitudes were 2.0&#x2013;2.20 times higher among those completing high school and diploma degrees than illiterate participants, respectively. In addition to this, participants with a prior encounter with the disease were 1.8 times more likely to have good attitudes about the brucellosis than their counterparts without a prior containment [AOR&#xA0;=&#xA0;1.8, 95% CI: (1.1&#x2013;2.7)] (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

          <title>Practice</title>
          <p id="p0080">Out of 313 participants (44.8%), it was revealed that they exclusively consume boiled and pasteurized milk. Only 262 (37.8%) individuals stated that they consume fresh (non-pasteurized) cheese. A total of 607 individuals affirmed that they exclusively consume thoroughly cooked animal meat. In the bivariate logistic regression analysis, it was observed that among the variables considered, age group was the sole factor that demonstrated a statistically significant impact on practice. Individuals older than 50 years were 1.4 times less likely to practice good brucellosis-related hygiene than their younger counterparts [AOR&#xA0;=&#xA0;0.6, 95% CI: (0.4&#x2013;0.8)] (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0085">Brucellosis, identified as the predominant bacterial zoonotic infection, is acknowledged as both a re-emerging and overlooked zoonotic ailment [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Addressing zoonotic diseases is of paramount importance, impacting both public health and economic aspects. Knowledge- and behavior-based management has been recognized by reputable sources as one of the most effective strategies for managing and controlling diseases like brucellosis [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, evaluating the overall disease knowledge/attitudes/practices of the high-risk population serves as a fundamental step for the development and implementation of more efficient interventions and brucellosis control programs that should fit the needs and perceptions of local communities [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our study showed that almost all of the participants had heard about this disease. The substantial disease awareness within the village is consistent with an endemic situation. The findings also indicate that while people in these rural areas were aware of brucellosis, their knowledge about its zoonotic characteristics, transmission modes, and preventive measures was relatively low. This implies that there may be a shallow and insufficient level of understanding about brucellosis in these regions. Inadequate knowledge about brucellosis represents a hurdle in the efforts to control and eliminate the disease [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].Despite the widespread awareness and accurate understanding of the disease, its transmission, and its consequences, the majority of individuals refrained from consuming boiled or pasteurized milk. This finding raises important questions about the complex interplay between knowledge, cultural practices, and perceived risks associated with the disease. This phenomenon highlights the multifaceted nature of health behavior in low-income rural settings [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One possible explanation for this behavior is the deeply ingrained cultural and traditional practices related to milk consumption [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, there may be a perceived trade-off between the perceived benefits of consuming raw milk, such as its taste and nutritional value, and the perceived risks of contracting brucellosis. This trade-off can influence individuals' decisions, as they weigh the potential health risks against the benefits they associate with consuming raw milk. Public health interventions and awareness campaigns should take into consideration these cultural and behavioral factors to effectively promote safer milk consumption practices.In our study, education level emerges as a significant predictor of knowledge and attitudes towards brucellosis. This finding can be well-justified by considering the broader implications of education on health-related awareness and perceptions. This is consistent with existing research in health education, which demonstrates that a higher level of education tends to equip individuals with improved access to information and a greater ability to understand and retain health-related knowledge [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
      <p id="p0090">Our results also indicate that individuals with a history of brucellosis tend to exhibit lower levels of knowledge and more negative attitudes toward this disease in comparison to those who have not previously been affected by it. This finding underscores the substantial influence of personal experience in shaping perceptions and awareness of brucellosis. Those who have directly encountered the disease may carry preconceptions and concerns based on their own experiences, potentially leading to reduced knowledge and less positive attitudes. Consequently, public health interventions must consider the diverse perspectives and needs of individuals with and without a history of brucellosis to ensure effective awareness and education programs that address these variations in understanding and attitudes.The finding that age group was the sole factor with a statistically significant impact on brucellosis-related practices underscores the importance of considering demographic variables in public health interventions. The observed disparity may be attributed to age-related factors such as physical limitations, variations in health literacy, and cultural influences. Practical implications of this result include the need for targeted educational programs that address the unique needs of older individuals, emphasizing the relevance and benefits of brucellosis prevention practices. Such interventions can contribute to closing the age-based gap in practicing preventive measures. However, further research should explore additional mediating factors and consider potential confounding variables to enhance the precision of intervention strategies.</p>
      <p id="p0095">Our study's methodology, rooted in assessing knowledge, attitudes, and practices within a specific population, holds promise for broader applications in infectious disease research. The structured questionnaire and stratified random sampling can be adapted to investigate similar aspects of other infectious diseases in diverse geographical contexts. The meticulous process of questionnaire development, expert evaluation, and pilot testing ensures robustness, contributing to the methodological transferability of our approach. This adaptability extends the potential impact of our study framework to various health-related inquiries, fostering a valuable template for understanding community perspectives on infectious diseases beyond brucellosis.</p>

        <title>Application to real-world practices and future directions</title>
        <p id="p0100">Our study highlights the need for targeted public health interventions to address the gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to brucellosis in the rural population of Ardabil province. To translate our findings into practical measures, we propose the following recommendations: In the realm of educational initiatives, a focus on designing and implementing campaigns aimed at enhancing awareness of brucellosis is suggested. These campaigns should be attuned to local contexts and consider cultural factors influencing health behaviors. A strategy involving community-based initiatives is recommended for delivering easily accessible information about brucellosis. Ensuring dissemination through widely used and trusted channels in the rural population is vital. To seamlessly integrate brucellosis awareness into routine healthcare services, strengthening collaboration with healthcare providers and local health authorities is proposed. This could involve incorporating relevant information into antenatal care, vaccination programs, and general health check-ups. Empowering livestock owners with knowledge and resources to adopt preventive practices is suggested. This includes advocating for proper animal vaccination, safe handling of animal products, and awareness of signs and symptoms of Brucellosis in animals.</p>

        <title>Research implications</title>
        <p id="p0105">Longitudinal studies are recommended to assess the sustained impact of educational interventions on knowledge, attitudes, and practices over time. Investigating the cultural and societal factors that shape health behaviors related to brucellosis is suggested to provide deeper insights for culturally sensitive interventions. Exploring opportunities for multi-sectoral collaboration involving agriculture, veterinary services, and public health to implement comprehensive One Health interventions for brucellosis control is proposed.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p id="p0110">Our study, while insightful, has inherent limitations that warrant consideration. The identification of age and education as pivotal factors shaping knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning brucellosis emphasizes the need for a more extensive exploration of sociodemographic determinants. The cross-sectional design provides valuable insights but restricts causal inferences and temporal assessments. The study's regional focus on rural Ardabil, Iran, may limit generalizability. Moving forward, longitudinal studies encompassing diverse sociocultural contexts are recommended for a more comprehensive understanding. Future research should delve into a broader array of variables, fostering a nuanced perspective on brucellosis-related behaviors.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p id="p0115">In conclusion, our study highlights the critical role of knowledge, attitudes, and practices in the management and control of brucellosis. While the awareness of brucellosis is high among the studied population, there exists a noteworthy gap in understanding its zoonotic nature, transmission modes, and preventive measures. This limited knowledge poses a considerable challenge to the effective control and elimination of the disease. The complex interplay of cultural practices, perceived risks, and benefits associated with raw milk consumption further underscores the multifaceted nature of health behaviors in low-income rural settings. Education emerges as a potent determinant of improved knowledge and attitudes toward brucellosis, emphasizing the importance of educational programs. Additionally, personal experiences with the disease shape perceptions, highlighting the need for tailored interventions for individuals with or without a history of brucellosis. Our findings further underline the significance of demographic factors, particularly age, in influencing preventive practices. As we move forward, it is essential to craft context-specific public health initiatives that account for these insights and address the multifaceted challenges posed by brucellosis in these regions.</p>
