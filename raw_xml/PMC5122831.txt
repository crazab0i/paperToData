This disease is characterized by abortion and reduced fertility in animals, and also by chronic infections with symptoms such as undulant fever, arthritis and osteomyelitis in humans (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The genus of Brucella consists of more than ten species, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> cause most of the animal and human diseases. <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> that mainly infects goats and sheep is considered as the most pathogenic species of Brucella to humans (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In animals, immunization against Brucella infections is usually performed by administration of the live attenuated smooth Brucella strains like <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19, <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1, and non-smooth strain <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, live attenuated vaccines have the limitations of causing abortion in immunized pregnant animals, being pathogenic for humans, inducing resistant to antibiotics and interfering with the lipopolysaccharides-based serological tests (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Up to now, there is no commercially available vaccine against human Brucellosis and the disease is prevented by immunization of uninfected animals and elimination of the infected ones (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To develop a human Brucella vaccine, those Brucella proteins that exist in Brucella strains pathogenic to humans but absent in Brucella strains and not pathogenic to humans would be ideal for vaccine development (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, Brucella outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are cell specific surface antigens which have remarkable immunogenicity characteristics. OMPs are excellent candidates in production of recombinant vaccines against Brucellosis (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These cell surface antigens are classified into two main groups consisting of OMP2a and OMP2b, and OMP25 and OMP31 (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). OMP25 antigen is one of the virulent factors and the major antigen involved in survival of Brucella and found to be highly conserved among different Brucella species.

Selection and production of new vaccine candidates are the primary practical steps toward introducing new vaccines. Major OMPs of Brucella species have been defined as immunogenic and protective antigens (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Omp25 is one such major OMP of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. Omp25 has been shown to be involved in virulence, as <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> is attenuated when infected with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> Omp25 mutant (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Omp25 has been shown to inhibit TNF-&#945; production in <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> infected human macrophages (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There are reports which have shown that DNA vaccine of Omp25 of <italic toggle="yes">B. meltensis</italic> is protective against the virulent <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> challenge in mice (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

The pET is the most powerful system has so far been developed for the cloning and expression of the recombinant proteins in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>. The pET32 series is designed for cloning and high-level expression of peptide sequences fused with the 109aa Trx&#8226;Tag&#8482; thioredoxin protein. Cloning sites available for producing fusion proteins also containi cleavable His&#8226;Tag&#174; and S&#8226;Tag&#8482; sequences for detection and purification. Target genes are cloned in pET plasmids under control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals where expression is induced by providing a source of T7 RNA polymerase in the host cells. T7 RNA polymerase is so active that when fully induced, almost all of the cell&#8217;s resources are converted to the target gene expression (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing of the cloning product confirmed the integrity of the cloning. The plasmid construct pET32(a)<sup>+</sup> Omp25 was transformed into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) containing T7 RNA polymerase and the expression was induced by the addition of IPTG. Successfully induced expression by different concentration of IPTG and high level production of the fusion demonstrated the high efficiency of our fusion construct. In addition, results indicated that multiple sequence alignment of different Brucella Omp25 sequences shows the protein is highly conserved among Brucella pathogens (99% - 100% sequence similarity) indicating that it could be a potential vaccine target against Brucella infection. The major difference was seen in Omp25 gene of <italic toggle="yes">B. ovis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic>.

In order to produce rOmp25 the cloning and expression were done successfully and results of sequencing and also SDS-PAGE and western blotting confirmed our rOmp25. In addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that selected gene was nearly similar in different Brucella species. The evaluation of humoral and cellular immune responses of this antigen against Brucella <italic toggle="yes">melitensis</italic> infection in mice has already been initiated in our laboratory.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by a grant in aid of research from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Pappas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Papadimitriou</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Christou</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Akritidis</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Future trends in human brucellosis treatmen</article-title><source>Expert Opin Investig Drugs</source><year>2006</year><volume>15</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>1141</fpage><lpage>1149</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1517/13543784.15.10.1141</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16989591</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Pappas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The changing Brucella ecology: novel reservoirs, new threats</article-title><source>Int J Antimicrob Agents</source><year>2010</year><volume>36</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>S8</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2010.06.013</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20696557</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Mulder</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Gilman</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Smits</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Human brucellosis</article-title><source>Lancet Infect Dis</source><year>2007</year><volume>7</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>775</fpage><lpage>786</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18045560</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi" assigning-authority="pmc">10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70286-4</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Corbel</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Brucellosis in humans and animals.
