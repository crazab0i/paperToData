      <title id="SEC1">Introduction</title>
      <p>Brucellosis, a zoonotic infection caused by
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> bacteria, poses a significant public health concern, affecting an estimated 3.5 billion people worldwide
<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> are transmitted primarily through close contact with the blood, feces, urine, and placenta of infected host animals. Infections can result in miscarriages in female animals and orchitis in males, leading to a decrease in reproductive capacity and compromising the quality and safety of animal products
<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In humans, brucellosis manifests as symptoms such as fever, arthritis, orchitis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, and endocarditis
<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Presently, several live attenuated vaccines, including S19, Rev.1, S2, SR82, and RB51, are widely used [
<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, these vaccines have certain limitations. For instance, some infections and complications may occur in humans, including the risk of miscarriage in pregnant cows
<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Given the absence of a licenced vaccine for human use, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine suitable for high-risk workers and individuals residing in endemic areas.
</p>
      <p>With advancements in molecular biology technology and a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of brucellosis, there is a promising opportunity for the development of new transgenic vaccines to replace conventional vaccines for brucellosis control. Moreover, recombinant protein vaccines based on antigen recognition have gained significant attention and have been extensively studied [
<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These vaccines, expressed in either eukaryotic or prokaryotic systems, offer the advantage of inducing high levels of antibodies while addressing safety concerns associated with live vaccines
<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Researchers have cloned various
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> outer membrane proteins and explored their immunogenicity in an effort to identify components that can effectively protect target animal species. Notable examples include p39
<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, OMP31
<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, Cu-Zn-SOD
<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, L7/L12
<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, OMP2b
<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and TF
<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These studies aimed to identify specific protein components that could be utilized in the development of protective vaccines. Among the many outer membrane proteins, BP26 is located in the periplasm of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and has been identified as an important diagnostic antigen for brucellosis. It is highly conserved in the
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> genus and widely used as a specific marker for diagnosing brucellosis [
<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2012;
<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a potential vaccine candidate, BP26 can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses in the host in combination with other agents, providing protection against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection [
<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, macrophages, which are the first line of defense against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, play a crucial role in linking innate and adaptive immunity. When being infected with
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, macrophages recognize, bind, and internalize the pathogen while also secreting soluble antimicrobial agents and innate immune mediators to defend against the infection. Although several
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> outer membrane proteins have been shown to activate macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, the function of rBP26 in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as its protective role in host defense against brucellosis, remains largely unknown.
</p>
      <p>To ensure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, we selected CpG as the adjuvant for our next study. CpG-ODN is a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide that contains non-methylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide. It mimics the activation of cellular DNA and has been shown to have potent adjuvant activity when co-administered with antigens, stimulating cell-mediated immune responses
<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Notably, CpG-ODNs have already been licenced as adjuvants for human hepatitis B virus vaccines, ensuring their safety.
</p>
      <p>In the present study, we successfully expressed rBP26 using a prokaryotic system. We then carried out further studies to investigate the effects of rBP26 on various aspects of the immune response, including macrophage polarisation, T lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and immune memory after immunisation. These findings provide a crucial theoretical foundation for better understanding the biological functions of BP26 and developing effective strategies for controlling brucellosis.</p>

        <title id="SEC2.5">Immunization</title>
        <p>Here we established an immunological system using inbred female C57BL/6N mice. Fifteen mice were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (injected with PBS only), the CpG group (injected with 40&#x2005;&#x3BC;g of CpG-ODN1826), and the rBP26+CpG group (injected with 30&#x2005;&#x3BC;g of rBP26 and 40&#x2005;&#x3BC;g of CpG-ODN1826). The mixture was then suspended in PBS and injected into the lower abdomen of the mice (100&#x2005;&#x3BC;L/mouse). To boost immunity, purified rBP26 was mixed with CpG ODN 1826 as a protein vaccine. We performed two boosts, as shown in

        <p>At the designated time after immunization, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and blood and spleen samples were collected from each mouse. Each spleen was minced and filtered through a 70-&#x3BC;m mesh filter. Approximately 5&#x2005;mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer was then added to the cell suspension, which was subsequently incubated on ice for 5&#x2005;min. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of PBS. The cells were subsequently centrifuged at 350

        <p>The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford kit. The proteins were subsequently boiled at 100&#xB0;C for 10&#x2005;min and separated by using 12% SDS-PAGE. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Solarbio Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) were used for protein transfer. The first antibody used for the rBP26 protein was obtained from the serum of immunized and control mice (1:500 dilution), and the second antibody used was goat anti-mouse IgG/HRP (1:20,000; Abcam, Shanghai, China). Finally, protein expression was analysed using an Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China) on a ChemiDocTM touch imaging system (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China).</p>

        <title id="SEC2.8">ELISA and ELISpot</title>
        <p>To begin the experiment, 200&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of splenocytes at a concentration of 2&#xD7;10
<sup>6</sup> cells/mL were inoculated into 96-well plates. These plates were divided into two groups: one group was treated with recombinant BP26 at a concentration of 10&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL, and the other group was not treated. Additionally, an anti-CD28 antibody was added to each well at a concentration of 1&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL. The plates were then placed in an environment at 37&#xB0;C with CO
<sub>2</sub> 5% concentration for 72&#x2005;h. After the incubation period, the culture supernatant was collected, and the levels of cytokines (IFN-&#x3B3;, TNF-&#x3B1;, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were measured using a BD OptEIA ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA). To stop the reaction, 1 M H
<sub>2</sub>SO
<sub>4</sub> was added to each well. The OD value of each well was then determined at a wavelength of 450&#x2005;nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA).
</p>
        <p>A BD OptEIA Mouse ELISPOT kit (BD Biosciences) was used for the detection of IFN-&#x3B3; and IL-4 puncta. First, the capture antibodies were diluted 1:250 in coating buffer, and the ELISPOT plates were diluted with 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of capture antibody per well. The plate was then sealed and incubated at 4&#xB0;C overnight. After the coated antibody was discarded, the wells were washed with 200&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of Closure Solution (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum). Subsequently, 200&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of Closure Solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 2&#x2005;h. The cells were suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 1&#xD7;10
<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and were incubated in ELISPOT plates at 200&#x2005;&#x3BC;L per well. This mixture was incubated at 37&#xB0;C and 5% CO
<sub>2</sub> in the presence of anti-CD28 (1&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL) with or without rBP26 (10&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL). The plates were subsequently washed twice with deionized water and three times with PBST. The detection antibody was diluted in dilution buffer (PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum) and incubated for 2&#x2005;h at 37&#xB0;C. This was achieved by adding 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of diluted detection antibody to each well. The plate was then washed three times with PBST. Next, a predetermined dilution of HRP-conjugated antibodies in 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of dilution buffer was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1&#x2005;h at 37&#xB0;C. The plates were washed four times with PBST and twice with PBS. Subsequently, 100&#x2005;&#x3BC;L of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) was added to each well. The substrate reaction was stopped using deionized water, and the spots were analyzed using an ELISPOT plate reader (AID Fluorospot; Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany).

        <title id="SEC2.9">Flow cytometric analysis</title>
        <p>To assess intracellular cytokine levels, cells were cultured at a concentration of 1&#xD7;10
<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in medium supplemented with an anti-CD28 antibody (1&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL). The cells were then incubated with or without rBP26 at a concentration of 10&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL for 24&#x2005;h. During the last 6&#x2005;h of incubation, brefeldin A (10&#x2005;&#x3BC;g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) was added. The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium (buffer 1) and stained with fluorescent dye-labelled monoclonal antibodies for 30&#x2005;min at 4&#xB0;C in the dark. This staining procedure was subsequently conducted for phenotypic analysis. After staining, the cells were washed with buffer 1 and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized overnight at 4&#xB0;C using buffer 2 (buffer 1 supplemented with 0.1% diosgenin). The cells were then stained with fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibodies in the dark at 4&#xB0;C for 30&#x2005;min. Following another wash with buffer 1, the levels of intracellular cytokines were determined using the BD Biosciences FACSCelesta method. The data were analyzed using FlowJo 10 software (TreeStar, San Carlos, USA). Prior to analysing the macrophages, they were treated with the Fcg blocking antibody against mouse CD16/32 for 10&#x2005;min, followed by the same steps as those used for the determination of intracellular factors.

The antibodies tested included IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgA. As anticipated, immunization with rBP26 resulted in significantly greater levels of rBP26-specific IgG antibodies and their subtypes than did immunization with the control agents (PBS and CpG). The peak antibody response for most subtypes, except for IgM, was observed two weeks after the final immunization and remained detectable for at least 8 weeks.

      <p>Brucellosis, a severe zoonotic disease, can be effectively controlled through vaccination. However, progress in the development of brucellosis vaccines has been slow, and human vaccines are not yet available. The challenge lies in developing a safe and effective vaccine against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, a parthenogenous intracellular pathogen that mainly resides in macrophages. Protective immunity against brucellosis relies on cellular immune responses dominated by the Th1 subpopulation of T lymphocytes, which play a central role in combating infection
<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Currently, vaccine development has entered the molecular vaccine stage, and recombinant protein vaccines show promise as safer, cheaper, and more suitable candidates for large-scale production than conventional vaccines. These recombinant protein vaccines have been shown to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Previous studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity and protective properties of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> OMPs, which are crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and selective permeability. As a result, additional studies have focused on using
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> membrane proteins as subunit vaccines to provide protection against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection [
<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x2012;
<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although many cell surface and intracellular components have been identified as potential factors for preventing
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, only low to moderate levels of protection have been achieved [
<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
</p>
      <p>In addition, previous research has focused primarily on OMPs [
<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], whereas BP26 was initially identified as the primary protein responsible for the immune response in animals infected with
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. It was discovered to possess a distinctive functional structural domain known as &#x201C;SIMPL,&#x201D; which implies that BP26 may have a role in the innate immune response pathway
<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This study aimed to further investigate the impact of BP26 on host immune responses and propose potential immune mechanisms.
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> enters the host and persists within host macrophages, resulting in chronic infection [
<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As the first line of defense against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, macrophages play a crucial role in maintaining internal environmental stability and eliminating pathogenic microorganisms
<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Macrophages (M0) employ various activation mechanisms to effectively combat pathogenic microorganisms and/or host mediators. These mechanisms equip them with either proinflammatory and bactericidal effects (M1 macrophages), which play a crucial role in humoral immunity and the proinflammatory response
<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, or anti-inflammatory effects (M2 macrophages), which are primarily involved in curbing the inflammatory response and facilitating tissue repair
<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, studies conducted on animals have revealed notable disparities in macrophage subpopulations during different stages of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. During the early/acute stage of infection, the presence of M1 macrophages fosters enhanced bactericidal capacity, while heightened expression of IFN-&#x3B3; leads to a reduction in
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> survival within the spleens of infected mice. In contrast, the later stages of infection are characterized by an increase in M2 macrophages, which prolongs the survival time of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>
<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Numerous studies have substantiated the efficacy of modulating macrophage polarization. Our findings indicate that, compared to those in the PBS and CpG groups, the proportion of M1-type macrophages significantly increased, while the proportion of M2 macrophages notably decreased in the rBP26-immunized group. Additionally, the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x3B1; and IL-6), vital effectors mediating macrophage resistance against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection, was augmented in the rBP26-immunized group. These cytokines stimulate phagocytic lysosomal fusion events and the generation of antimicrobial effectors such as ROS, NO, and lysosomal enzymes [
<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, these
<italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments suggest that BP26 serves as a pivotal initiator of innate immunity, specifically activating macrophages to trigger antimicrobial effectors, thereby facilitating early control of infection.

      <p>Macrophages play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity, acting as a vital link between the two. Upon receiving activation signals from antigen-presenting cells, initial CD4
<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into various helper T-cell subtypes, guided by the provided information and cytokines. Th1 cells secrete type 1 cytokines, such as IFN-&#x3B3;, which are key cytokines in the immune response to
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. This cytokine not only protects the host during the early stages of infection but also stimulates the proliferation of CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells. On the other hand, Th2 cells secrete type 2 cytokines, such as IL-4
<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which contribute to the chronic infection caused by
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>
<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The results of this study, obtained through ELISA, ELISPOT, and flow cytometry analysis, demonstrated that immunization with rBP26 effectively stimulated the production of Th1-type cytokines, including IFN-&#x3B3;, IL-2, and TNF-&#x3B1;, while Th2-type cytokines, such as IL-4, were not significantly affected compared to those in the PBS or CpG group. Furthermore, rBP26 also stimulated the production of IFN-&#x3B3; by both CD4
<sup>+</sup> and CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells. These findings suggest that rBP26 induces a Th1-biased T-cell response, which may contribute to the protective effects against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection
<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Overall, these results provide further evidence that modulating macrophage polarization and promoting a Th1-type immune response, as achieved through rBP26 immunization, can effectively control
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection. By activating macrophages and stimulating the production of antimicrobial effectors, rBP26 serves as a crucial initiator of innate immunity, facilitating the early control of infection. This study highlights the importance of macrophages and T-cell responses in the immune defense against
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and provides valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
</p>
      <p>Antibody-mediated humoral immune responses also play a crucial role in regulating the levels of circulating
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in the bloodstream of infected hosts. Compared to those in the PBS or CpG groups, the presence of rBP26-induced antibodies persisted for a longer duration, and the IgG titres were greater. Moreover, the production of both IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies increased. These observations suggest that rBP26 effectively induces Th1-type cellular immune responses and stimulates the production of associated antibodies
<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, our study revealed that the introduction of rBP26 resulted in an increase in CD69 and CD25 expression on CD4
<sup>+</sup> and CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells after exposure to the homologous antigen for one day. The frequency of CD69 expression was notably greater in the rBP26 group than in the PBS and CpG groups. Additionally, rBP26 also facilitated the proliferation of specific CD4
<sup>+</sup> and CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells. In conclusion, the changes in cytokine and antibody profiles, together with the enhanced activation and proliferation of CD4
<sup>+</sup> and CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to rBP26, collectively indicate the effectiveness of rBP26 in stimulating Th1-type cellular immune responses and associated antibody production
<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.
</p>
      <p>Immune memory is an essential aspect of adaptive immune responses, and the formation and maintenance of memory cells are crucial for inducing long-lasting protective immunity
<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. While the production of cytokines and antibodies is associated with terminal differentiation and exhaustion, memory cells are responsible for controlling
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> and other infections, manifested in the secondary response of the immune system to encountered antigens. Among memory cells, CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in controlling pathogenic infections. Therefore, the generation of protective memory CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells through vaccination is an attractive strategy for preventing and treating various human diseases. These memory CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells enhance the host&#x2032;s ability to defend against secondary infections [
<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x2012;
<xref rid="REF45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
</p>
      <p>Given the importance of optimizing vaccine-induced immunity, it is crucial to determine the composition of protective memory CD8
<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. In our study, we observed that, compared with the control treatment, vaccination with rBP26 induced both effector and central memory CD4
<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4
<sup>+</sup> TEM and CD4
<sup>+</sup> TCM cells) as well as CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8
<sup>+</sup> TEM and CD8
<sup>+</sup> TCM cells). Furthermore, effector memory CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells were found to persist for up to 8 weeks after the last immunization. These findings suggest that the rBP26 vaccine promotes the development of durable immune memory, which is primarily dominated by effector memory CD8
<sup>+</sup> T cells. This further enhances our understanding of BP26-induced protective T-cell immunity and advances research on anti-brucellosis vaccines.
</p>
      <p>Our findings provide valuable insights into the immunological properties of rBP26. We observed that rBP26 induces M1 macrophage polarization, promoting Th1-type cellular immune responses. Additionally, rBP26 has been shown to stimulate lymphocyte activation and proliferation, resulting in long-lasting immune memory. These novel findings build upon previous basic immunological studies of rBP26 and offer significant contributions toward understanding the immune mechanisms involved in host clearance of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. With these compelling results, further studies focusing on rBP26 as a recombinant protein vaccine hold great promise in the prevention of
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infections.
