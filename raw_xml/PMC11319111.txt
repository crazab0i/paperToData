      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite many studies worldwide, as one of the most prevalent bacterial zoonotic infectious diseases, brucellosis is a serious problem in endemic areas, including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease causes offspring mortality, reduced milk production, and infertility in domestic animals and wild mammals [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human brucellosis, caused by direct contact with various species of infected animals or consumption of infected dairy products, is a systemic illness with undulant fever. Although brucellosis is managed using antibiotics, recovery needs long treatment duration and different combinations of antibiotics in case of relapses [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The disease is caused by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, a small intracellular Gram-negative, nonmotile, non-spore-forming aerobic coccobacillus. DNA sequence among the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> genus has 94% homology; therefore, immunity by any effective brucellosis vaccine can induce cross-protection against other species [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> can successfully escape immune responses and resists antimicrobial agents by entering the mononuclear phagocyte cells [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These features are challenging to develop effective vaccines due to the need for improved drug development strategies.</p>
      <p>As an important goal for many research groups, new molecular techniques have been introduced to create safe, effective, engineered therapeutic agents like vaccines to prevent and control microbial infections [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this regard, recombinant subunit proteins based on <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigens have been designed and expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic systems indicating a safer profile than live organism-based vaccines and acceptable immunoreactivity in laboratory conditions; however, these may confer less efficacy [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, adjuvant systems have been suggested to enhance their efficacy by improving immunogenicity [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Niosomes have been presented as strong immunogenic-adjuvant agents. These non-ionic amphiphilic vesicles are into closed bilayer structures which are applied as well targeted delivery systems by their stability, easy modification, and delayed clearance [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, research-based evidence demonstrated that the mannosylated niosomes serve as a useful strategy for improving the efficacy of vaccines due to the possibility of antigen delivery by mucosal or topical routes and better properties for the controlled release of the loaded molecule. Moreover, mannose receptors are highly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells as the major antigen-presenting cells (APCs); therefore, mannosylated vaccine delivery systems increase the attraction of immune cells and, as a result, improve immunogenicity [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>There is currently no effective and approved vaccine for human brucellosis. Therefore, researchers intend to develop a safe and effectual vaccine using new nanostructured drug delivery systems and engineered antigens to protect at-risk workers and general populations in endemic areas. As carbohydrates enhance the immunogenicity of a vaccine by binding to specific glycan-binding receptors on the surface of APCs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], this study aimed to develop a niosome-based nanoparticle vaccine candidate containing recombinant trigger factor/Bp26/Omp31 (rTBO) chimeric protein and assess its potency in the induction of immune response in BALB/c mice.</p>

        <title>Materials</title>
        <p>Anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma Corp., Kawasaki, Japan), cholesterol (Sigma Corp.), bovine serum albumin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) Span 80, Tween 60 (Merck), 3,3&#x2019;,5,5&#x2019;-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma Corp.), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (NUNC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used in this study. Live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic> RB51 and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1 vaccines were obtained from Razi Vaccine &amp; Serum Research Institute (Karaj, Iran) and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain 544 and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M bacterial strains were obtained from the microbial collection of Pasteur Institute of Iran (Tehran, Iran). Female BALB/c laboratory mice with a lifespan of 6&#x2013;8 weeks obtained from the Pasteur Institute of Iran were used.</p>

        <title>Preparation of mannosylated rTBO-niosomes</title>
        <p>Niosomes encapsulated with rTBO chimeric protein was used to create mannosylated niosomes nanostructures. Briefly, the rTBO chimeric gene was expressed in the expression vector pET28a (+) on <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) strain. The recombinant protein produced with a 6&#xD7;His-tag was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The Bradford protein assay was performed to measure proteins concentration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were used for confirmation and analysis of purified protein.</p>
        <p>Niosomes containing rTBO were prepared by thin film hydration as previously described with some modification [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, Tween 60, Span 80, and cholesterol in 1:1:0.85 molar ratios were dissolved in 10 mL chloroform into a long-necked quick-fit round-bottom flask. The solvent was slowly evaporated at 56&#x2103;, using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) at 140 revolutions per minute (rpm) such that a thin, dry film of the components was formed on the inner wall of the flask. The dried thin layer was then hydrated with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 10 mg rTBO by rotating the flask in a water bath under normal pressure to ensure complete hydration of the film. The niosomal suspension was left to mature overnight at 4&#x2103;.</p>
        <p>To synthesize mannosylated niosome, all the above process was done, and mannosylated cholesterol was used (generous gift of Dr. Mehdi Rahimi-Nasrabadi) instead of cholesterol.</p>

        <title>Determining the encapsulation efficacy of antigen in niosomes</title>
        <p>Antigen-containing nanoparticles were washed using PBS to remove the free and unencapsulated antigen and mixed with isopropyl alcohol at a volume ratio of 1:9 to break the lipid wall around the antigen and release the protein. In the next step, the amount of absorption of the encapsulated antigen was calculated using a Bradford assay. At the end, by using the standard curve of antigen in isopropyl alcohol and the formula EE=B/A&#xD7;100, the percentage of antigen inclusion in nanoparticles was calculated. Where EE is encapsulation efficacy, A is the amount of protein used initially, and B is the amount of protein in isopropyl alcohol dissolved nanoparticles.</p>

        <title>Determination of protein release rate</title>
        <p>To check the release pattern of the recombinant protein, 30 mg of protein-containing nanoparticles were poured into a 2 mL microtube in a volume of 1 mL of PBS solution and dispersed by stirring. The microtube was placed in a beaker at 37&#x2103; and 100 rpm, and the solution was sampled at regular intervals. Then, the solution containing nanoparticles was centrifuged for 30 seconds at a speed of 10,000, and 700 &#xB5;L of the supernatant solution were removed and stored at -20&#x2103;. To the amount of the collected solution, PBS buffer was added to the microtube, and after vortex, it was placed in a shaker Bain-Marie. At first, sampling was done for 1 and 2 hours, and then every 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours. After 96 hours, the concentration of the samples was determined using a Bradford assay. The percentage curve of protein released from nanoparticles was drawn in the specified periods.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Characterization of nanoparticles</title>
        <p>The nanoparticles were centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. To wash and disperse the precipitated nanoparticles by adding deionized water, the centrifugation process was repeated 3 times. After centrifugation, the remaining suspension was turned into a powder by a freeze-drying machine and resuspended in 5 mL of deionized distilled water to determine the particle size with a DLS device according to the number, intensity, and volume of the particles at a viscosity of 0.8872.</p>
        <p>After sample preparation on a microscope slide, a 30 kW XL scanning electron microscope photographed the nanoparticles to determine the size and shape of them.</p>

        <title>Immunization experiments</title>
        <p>Female 6&#x2013;8 weeks old BALB/c mice were used for <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> studies. The study was carried out under the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the Islamic Azad University of Qom under ethical approval number IR.IAU.QOM.REC.1398.026.</p>
        <p>In this study, two intraperitoneal and intranasal routes were used for immunization. To determine the effect of nanostructures to induce the immune response, four groups of ten BALB/c mice were immunized with the intraperitoneal injection or intranasal inoculation of 20 &#xB5;g of vaccine compounds on days 0, 14, and 28. The first group received antigen, the second and third groups received rTBO loaded niosome and mannosylated niosome, respectively, and the fourth group received PBS as a control. Positive control groups were immunized with attenuated <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev vaccines with a dose of 1&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Blood sampling and evaluating the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG antibodies</title>
        <p>Blood was collected from immunized mice on days 10, 24, and 38 and their serum was separated and stored at -70&#x2103;. These samples were used to evaluate immunoglobulin A (IgA), total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a subclasses.</p>
        <p>The indirect ELISA method investigated the amount of total IgG, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies in immunized mice to determine immune responses. In this regard, 5 &#xB5;g of recombinant protein (antigen) were dissolved in 100 &#xB5;L of coating buffer (sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, 0.05 M; pH=9.6) and poured into each well of the microplate, except the control well, incubated overnight at 4&#x2103;. After washing, the wells were blocked with 100 &#xB5;L of blocking buffer (containing PBST containing 3% gelatin) and 1 hour of incubation at 37&#x2103;. A volume of 100 &#xB5;L of serially diluted serum samples were added to each well and placed in a shaker incubator at 37&#x2103; for 45 minutes. Then, 100 &#xB5;L of the conjugated antibodies were added to each well and incubated at 37&#x2103; for 1 hour and washed with PBST buffer. A volume of 100 &#xB5;L of TMB substrate was added to each well, and the microplate was transferred to a dark place to conduct the reaction. At the end, after the color of the solution changed to blue, the reaction was stopped with 2.5 M sulfuric acid, and an ELISA reader read the optical density of the wells at a wavelength of 450 nm.</p>

        <title>Spleen cells culturing and cytokine evaluation</title>
        <p>Three mice from each group were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last immunization, and their spleens were obtained and aseptically homogenized. Then, the red blood cells were removed from splenocytes suspension using ammonium chloride buffer. Splenocytes were counted, and a suspension containing 4&#xD7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL was prepared for each sample, and 100 &#xB5;L containing 4&#xD7;10<sup>5</sup> cells was added to each 96-well cell culture plate and incubated with 5% carbon dioxide for 1 hour in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Loughborough, UK; containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin). Then, 10 &#xB5;g of the specific antigen related to each cell group was added to the and kept in an incubator at 37&#xB0; and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 72 hours. Spleen cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin-A were considered positive control, and spleen cells incubated with RPMI 1640 were negative control. After 72-hour incubation, supernatants of cultured cells were used to determine interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x3B3;), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and interleukin 12 (IL-12) cytokines levels. The kit was used to measure cytokines, and the method was according to the kit&#x2019;s instructions [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

        <p>The western blot indicated a single band of the rTBO protein with an approximate weight of 70 kD, consistent with the predicted weight and antigenic similarities with the natural form of this protein. Moreover, the recombinant protein was soluble.</p>
        <p>The nanoparticles produced were often spherical and had a relatively smooth surface, and the accumulation of nanoparticles and the formation of clots did not observe (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The zeta potential of nanoparticles containing recombinant protein was about -20 mV, and its average size was 100 nm.</p>
        <p>The encapsulation efficiency was 81.96%&#xB1;1.4%. Examining the release rate showed that the protein was released explosively at first, and on the second day, about 23% of the total loaded protein was released. In total, during the 96-hour study period, about 97% of the protein trapped in the nanoparticles was released.</p>

        <title>Measurement of IgA, IgG, and serum IgG isotypes</title>
        <p>The ELISA analysis of the serum was performed to evaluate the concentration of the immunoglobulins. Based on the serum serial dilutions against antigens and nanostructures, an antibody titer of 1/128,000 niosome was detected, indicating high immune system stimulation. Ten days after the intraperitoneal injection, a high antibody level produced by niosomal antigen (Nio-Ag) and mannosylated noisomal antigen (Nio-Man-Ag) was produced compared to the control. Similarly, in the 24th and 38th days after the injection, nanostructures had higher immunogenicity than free antigens and control. Similar results were observed for the intranasal method. The results are shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
        <p>In the examination of IgG isotypes (IgG1 and IgG2a) to determine the type of immune stimulation, the results showed a high antibody titer on the 38th day, which indicated a no significant difference between intraperitoneal and nasal route of antigen administration (p&gt;0.05). Results are shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.</p>
        <p>Although all niosomal combinations induced IgG2a and IgG1 production, the IgG2a/IgG1 titer ratio was 1.2 and 1.1 in Nio-Man-Ag after the intraperitoneal and intranasal injection methods, respectively. However, other groups revealed a ratio of less than one.</p>
        <p>Examination of serum IgA on day 24 showed a significant increase in the Nio-Man-Ag group compared to other groups and control in both injection methods (p&lt;0.05). The results are shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>

        <p>Based on <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-&#x3B3; production in the intraperitoneal injection were significantly higher in the immunized mouse models with nanoparticles containing rTBO protein than in the negative control group (p&lt;0.05). However, the cytokines production was similar between the study groups and the positive control group receiving <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1 vaccine (p&gt;0.05). Intranasal administration indicated a higher cytokine production by nanostructure than in the negative control group (PBS).

      <p>Brucellosis is a global problem, and the lack of access to an effective human vaccine and the complications caused by animal vaccines are among the factors that have prevented the eradication of this disease worldwide. Inventing new genetic engineering methods, using recombinant chimeric proteins with antigenic and adjuvant properties, nanostructures as drug delivery carriers, and designing new vaccines based on the natural pathogenesis pattern have caused reduced risks of available vaccines, increasing immunogenic properties, and targeting antigen transfer to immune cells. In this regard, the design of an effective vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> that selectively induces cellular and humoral immune response can be done by selecting a suitable nanoniosome formulation as an immunoadjuvant and recombinant protein as an immune response-stimulating antigen. Therefore, the present study investigated the intranasal and intraperitoneal immunization of the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine candidate designed based on mannosylated niosome nanostructures containing rTBO chimeric protein in the mouse model. The results presented the cellular and humoral immune response and cytokine production in the <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infectious model, whit a higher immune response in the intraperitoneal than intranasal administration.</p>
      <p>The present study applied mannose in the noisome nanostructures to target the delivery of recombinant proteins to immune cells. Receptors can recognized carbohydrates on the surface of APCs and, when associated with an antigen, can enhance uptake via endocytosis/phagocytosis, as mannose can be recognized by mannose receptors [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, coating the surface of nanoparticles and nanocapsules with mannose has enhanced antigen uptake by APCs [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> mannose also activates the complement system through the lectin pathway. Mannose-binding lectin is one of the important components in innate immunity, which is produced by hepatocytes in the liver and triggers the complement activation cascade, resulting in various antibodies [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, targeting by mannose is used to prevent non-specific interactions and, on the other hand, to increase absorption by immune cells, which by binding to their receptors on the surface of immune system cells, especially APCs, activates these cells and initiates inflammatory responses.</p>
      <p>Serum IgG indicated a high antibody titer in immunized animals using nanostructures compared with free antigens and negative control. Low stimulation using free antigen may arise from removing it by digestive enzymes and the blood refining system before effective contact with immune cells. These findings confirm the efficacy of nanoparticles as a strong delivery and adjuvant system in stimulating the immune system, in addition to rising protein stability. Therefore, the formulation of immunological proteins with nanoparticles increases the immunogenic power with small antigen concentrations. Furthermore, comparing the immunogenicity between formulations indicated higher immune system stimulation by Nio-Ag compared with the Nio-M-Ag; however, the endpoint detection was similar. As previously reported, mannose can interact with mannose receptors displayed on APCs and, as a result, activate the cellular immune response, which in return activates a more robust and prolonged immunization. In line with these findings, a previous study on mannosylated niosomes as a topical vaccine delivery carrier and adjuvant for the induction of both humoral and cellular immunity in albino rats reported a niosomal formulations elicited a significantly higher serum IgG titer upon topical application as compared with controls [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, inconsistent with our results, this study presented the potential higher efficacy of mannosylated niosomes than plain uncoated niosomes [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some other reports have also emphasized the effectiveness of nanovaccines modified by mannose moiety [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the present study rejected the superiority of mannosylated modification to free nanoparticles, this observation may result from the methodology and physicochemical structure of created Nio-Man.</p>
      <p>Based on immunological studies, IgG2a/IgG1 ratio represents cellular and humoral immune response proportion. In this regard, T helper type 1 (Th1)-dependent cytokines, such as IL-12 and IFN-&#x3B3;, stimulate IgG2a, whereas T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines inhibit it by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. In the present study, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio was more than one in intranasal and intraperitoneal immunization by Nio-Man-Ag, indicating an immune shift towards cellular immunity in immunized mice and a tendency towards stimulating the T cell response. Conversely, free antigen, Nio-Ag, and standard vaccines Rev.1 and RB51, with a ratio lower than 1, stimulated humoral immunity under the antigen-stimulated spleen cell producing a higher proportion of IgG1 than IgG2a. In line with our results, oral immunization with mannosylated nanoparticles resulted in higher IgG2a levels (Th1 response) related to the mannosylation strategy of the nanoparticles [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A previous study has also reported serum IgG2a/IgG1 response by niosomal formulations; however, inconsistent with our data, IgG1 response was predominant, indicating superiority of humoral response. These findings support the stimulation of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes and activate cellular and humoral responses by particulate antigens, whereas soluble antigens stimulate Th2 and humoral response [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consequently, combining antigens in mannosylated niosomes may provoke both humoral and cellular immunity. Although, further investigations should consider T lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production to completely characterize the immune response stimulated by the niosomal system.</p>
      <p>The current study showed a significantly increased serum IgA by intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of the Nio-Man-Ag. Similarly, a study on oral genetic immunization against hepatitis B also reported the effectiveness of nanoparticles, especially mannosylated niosomes, in the mucosal immune response, as the highest salivary IgA level was observed by administration of <italic toggle="yes">o</italic>-palmitoyl mannan-coated niosomes containing DNA vaccine [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Another study investigating nanoparticles for oral antigen delivery revealed that oral immunization with mannosylated niosomes induced a higher mucosal IgA response by lymphocytes [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>Evaluation of cytokine production revealed significantly higher levels of IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-&#x3B3; in the intranasal and intraperitoneal immunized mouse models with nanoparticles containing rTBO than in the negative control. Moreover, cytokine levels were similar between intraperitoneal injection and positive controls receiving <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 and <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1 vaccines. These findings showed the immune response stimulation of the immunized mice through cellular and humoral pathways by the stimulation of Th1 and Th2, which is the most favorable result regarding the production of a vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. As well to the injection approach, there was a significant difference in the production of cytokines between the immunized mice and the negative controls in the intranasal method. In the serum of immunized mice, there was a high production of IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-&#x3B3; compared to the negative control group. These observations also demonstrated the activation of both humoral and cellular immunity by immunization via the intranasal method using Nio-Man-Ag. In line with these findings, previous investigations revealed increased levels of Th1 cytokines, including IL-12 and IFN-&#x3B3; production after parenteral administration of mannosylated cationic liposomes [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and mannan-coated liposome-protamine-DNA nanoparticles [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This observation can be illustrated by the efficacious endocytosis of mannosylated peptides to dendritic cells more than non-mannosylated ones by mannose receptors [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>Higher IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-&#x3B3; levels in the intraperitoneal injection than in the intranasal method presented a better stimulation of the immune response in mice immunized with nanoparticles containing rTBO protein using the injection method. Also, the combination of Nio-Man-Ag had the highest stimulating potency of the immune system. Intranasal vaccination has introduced one of the most favorable methods presenting advantages, including prevention of enzymatic and proteolytic degradation and a large surface for deposition and absorption [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A study on intestinal parasites of lambs has shown a strong immune response and significant protection [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another study in cattle using intranasal and subcutaneous vaccination revealed the effect of the delivery mechanism in stimulating the systemic and mucosal immune responses [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this regard, some evidence indicated the efficacious potential function of intranasal administration using subunit and live vaccines for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccination [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
      <p>Considering bacterial count revealed protection in immunized mice against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> 16M and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544, confirming the potential role of niosomes containing rTBO recombinant protein to induce immunity as similar live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> Rev.1 vaccine and <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 compared with negative control. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the combination of mannosylated noisome and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> rTBO recombinant chimeric proteins induce IgG and IgA production during infection; as a result, stimulating the cellular and humoral immune response. Moreover, it can create significant lymphocyte responses during the natural course of pathogenic bacteria infection by producing cytokines, playing a role in developing the protective acquired immune response in the infectious model. These findings present the rTBO chimeric protein as a suitable candidate for the design of immunogenic compounds against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Although the parenteral method resulted in a successful enhancement of cytokines production than intranasal administration, further studies suggested developing strategies to increase the antibodies levels and reduce their removal by digestive enzymes using a proper delivery system or changing the vaccination method to more effectively reduce bacterial colonization in the host.</p>
