In fact, the US government has allocated millions of dollars to the cause [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The current measures of trapping, hunting, and poison baiting have not been effective enough to control their spread. This species causes about $1.5&#8211;2.5 billion in agricultural damage a year in the USA, and feral swine continue to thrive in almost every state [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Not only do these prolific breeders pose a threat to the agricultural economy, but they also pose a threat to domestic herds and public health. Feral swine are known carriers of over 67 different zoonotic disease causing agents including <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp., African Swine Fever, pseudorabies, and hemorrhagic <italic toggle="yes">E.&#160;coli</italic> [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In fact, there have been multiple human illnesses confirmed to be from feral swine interactions [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Of particular importance is the causative agent of brucellosis, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. seroprevalence in feral swine populations has been reported as high as 50% in parts of the USA, and they could easily transmit the disease to unvaccinated domestic animals or hunters [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for a vaccine that can both reduce fertility and prevent the spread of swine brucellosis.</p><p id="p0015">The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) has set specific criteria for the creation of an ideal immunocontraceptive wildlife vaccine. The vaccine must: be safe for the target species, be free of undesirable side effects, not spill over and affect non-target species, not prevent the target species from being safe to consume, cause little social effect on the target species, and produce a long-term but reversible infertility [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many components of the reproductive system have been targeted to try and achieve these specific criteria, but the search for strong vaccine candidates continues. The current front-runners are the porcine zona pellucida (PZP) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) targeting vaccines [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, the USDA's multimeric-GnRH vaccine, GonaConTM, has been approved and used in multiple wildlife species to control their populations. Improvac/Improvest&#174;, another GnRH based vaccine, has been successfully approved for use in the swine industry to prevent boar taint [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. GnRH, when conjugated with highly immunogenic antigens, has proven to be successful in the interruption of fertility allowing these two subunit vaccines to become an industry standard [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The vaccine candidates evaluated in this study provide advantages for use in feral swine including: culturability, forgoing the expensive purification process of subunit vaccines, and the possibility for administration of the vaccine using oral bait.</p><p id="p0020">GnRH is a small peptide hormone that is produced by the hypothalamus and regulates the production of pituitary gonadotropins; luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In simple terms, these hormones have receptors throughout the body and are vital in the production of sperm and testosterone in the male, along with follicular development, ovulation, and pregnancy in the female. Ultimately, GnRH is at the top of this hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and stimulates the production of LH and FSH, both leading to many sex-specific fertility characteristics. FSH in the male stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testis and the maturation of spermatids. In the female, FSH nurtures the developing follicle to become an ovulatory follicle. FSH is a vital hormone in successful reproduction and is composed of two subunits (&#945; and &#946;) [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The &#946; subunit has variable homology between species and is more important in the receptor binding process [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This fact could provide a potentially safer immunocontraceptive target that could be designed to more specifically target a species in field applications.</p><p id="p0025">To evaluate if the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis has been negatively affected there are various fertility characteristics that can be measured. In veterinary medicine, specific methods of quantifying these characteristics are part of a breeding soundness exam attempting to determine the ability of an animal to reproduce. Some of these parameters include sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, testicular size, hormone levels, birth/pregnancy rates, fetal viability, and anatomical conformation [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Before analysis of abnormal, &#8216;normal&#8217; fertility characteristics need to be defined. BALB/c inbred mice have been used in research since 1923 and substantial data on their reproductive characteristics exists. In addition, these characteristics are closely monitored and reported by research strain suppliers. Their average litter size is between five and seven pups, and they are uniformly considered good breeders with a long reproductive life stage [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One report in the literature opposes this view showing a 32% infertility rate, but the circumstances of the matings are not well described. The large majority of the literature reports between 0-10% infertility rates [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Primiparous monogamous pairs in particular have been reported to have 100% fertility rates [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Non-viable fetuses per litter are reported on average between 1 and 2 fetuses [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The epididymal sperm concentrations in male BALB/c mice have been reported to be between 15.5 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> &#177; 4.4 and 7.67 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> &#177; 1.41 sperm/mL at around 80 days of age [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

This is difficult to achieve in the murine model, and will be discussed further towards the end of this discussion [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This effect is further supported with the strain RB51LFSH&#946; and RB51LGnRH immunized groups having lower uterine weights and higher odds ratios for non-viable fetuses, compared to the control groups. There are several limitations with this study that could affect this data, though. The males remained with the females until euthanasia making it a possibility that the smaller fetuses, classified as non-viable, in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;5</xref>a,c,d,e are viable fetuses. This is a feasible argument against the viability counts, but this does not impact the overall analysis of the impact on female fertility. The total fetal counts were statistically lower in strain RB51LFSH&#946; and RB51LGnRH immunized females. Furthermore, these findings could be further validated if the females were allowed to give birth for live pup counts, or if the males were removed after the presence of a sperm plug. However, this was beyond the ethical scope of this study. It was designed to mimic the natural reality of multiple copulations. Plus, the prediction of fertilization via the presence of a sperm plug is unreliable [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nonetheless, the females were checked every morning for sperm plugs, and the only sperm plugs observed were within the first four days post pairing. This suggests that there were only copulations in the first four days. Another analytical limitation with this study is the fact that the placenta can not be fully evaluated microscopically until estimated gestation day 7.5. Thus, uterine artery distension, fetal sizes, distribution of the fetuses, and the overall appearance of the uterus/placenta were used to further characterize viability [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p id="p0125">In strains RB51LFSH&#946;, RB51LGnRH, and Improvest&#174; immunized males, the sperm concentrations, testis volumes, and testis weights were lower compared to the PBS control males, further supporting a vaccine effect. Testicular volumes and weights are good prognostic indicators of fertility, and the vaccinated males in this study prognostically had lower fertility compared to PBS control mice. The PBS control mice in this study had fertility characteristics that fall within the normal parameters of BALB/c male mice reported in the literature [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0130">The link between the vaccinations and these effects on the male gonad is further supported via the antibody ELISA absorbance and testosterone values. Following the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the reduced testosterone levels, sperm counts, seminiferous tubule diameters, and testis volumes of the strain RB51LGnRH immunized group suggest that the GnRH antibodies detected on ELISA are disrupting the entire pathway [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In male mice immunized with strain RB51LFSH&#946;, the testosterone levels were more similar to the control mice. They also had reduced sperm counts, seminiferous tubule diameters, and testis volumes suggesting that the porcine FSH&#946; antibodies detected on ELISA were interrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at a lower level, as the production of testosterone was still being stimulated at a normal level. It is important to realize however, that testosterone is produced in waves. Thus, multiple serum samples over the length of the study would need to be analyzed to further verify this vaccine effect. It is also necessary to take into account that most mammals have circulating autoantibodies against their reproductive hormones [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This could account for the ELISA absorbance values seen from the control mouse serum. Determination of the GnRH and FSH&#946; antibody ELISA absorbance values from pre-vaccinated serum would add validity to these conclusions. Determining the ELISA absorbance values two weeks after initial vaccination and booster vaccination would also provide a more complete data set, giving insight into the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates. The number of anesthetized blood collections needed to address the above limitations was beyond the ethical scope of this study, though.</p><p id="p0135">In a similar manner to the males, further testing of hormone levels and ovarian function would be needed to evaluate the extent of the vaccinations&#8217; effects on the strain RB51LFSH&#946; immunized diestral female. This finding could indicate a target level for porcine FSH&#946; IgG antibody ELISA absorbance values in female mice needed to produce 100% infertility. Ultimately this could suggest the need for a higher antibody response with an adjuvant, as the sera from diestral female had the highest FSH&#946; ELISA absorbance values [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">The uniform robust antibody response needed to further inhibit fertility may be inhibited by the fact that FSH has been shown to have low expression due to a hairpin structure in its mRNA [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This would reduce the amount of the protein produced by the vaccine strain, thereby causing a low immune response [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The protein has also been shown, in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli,</italic> to be expressed in inclusion bodies, which if true in <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> could prevent a robust immune response. This could also reduce the likelihood of detection on Western blot [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We did notice a decreased growth rate and lighter plasmid PCR bands (Supplemental Figure 1B) with the strain RB51LFSH&#946; compared to the other strains. Further testing would be needed to confirm this. In addition, further protocols for solubilization of protein inclusion bodies would need to be performed to further investigate the protein expression. Although, a FliC-porcineFSH&#946; protein was not explicitly detected through western blotting, the antibody ELISA data, fetal numbers, sperm concentrations, testis volumes, and other reduced fertility characteristics show that the vaccine candidates did have an effect compared to PBS control mice. This suggests that the strain RB51LFSH&#946; is producing a FliC-porcineFSH&#946; protein, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo,</italic> to produce an antibody response, all-be-it too low to confer 100% infertility.</p><p id="p0145">A limitation in the use of FSH as an immunogenic target was identified in the literature, but expression and immune response studies would need to be done to confirm this in rodents and swine. It has been stated in literature that vaccination of humans with FSH does not reduce sperm concentrations to a low enough level to cause infertility, despite antibody responses [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These claims and observations could possibly be overcome through immunization with both vaccine strains, the use of FSH&#946; epitopes as a target, or even with the use of the USDA's AdjuVac&#8482; adjuvant. This strong adjuvant has been shown to be effective for use with contraceptive vaccines in wildlife to stimulate robust immune responses [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The use of this adjuvant may also allow for a single injection of the vaccine candidates to provide immunocontraception, but this needs to be confirmed.</p><p id="p0150">Although our vaccines did not induce 100% infertility, there are several important limitations to further consider. First, in regards to the strain RB5LFSH&#946; immunized group, the FSH&#946; subunit sequence used is specific for swine and not mice. Thus, further studies are needed in swine. Second, the use of mice was a major limitation in this study. Russell, <italic toggle="yes">et&#160;al.</italic> explicitly describes limitations to using rodents for fertility and breeding studies. These limitations include that spermatogenesis must be decreased by 90% or more to affect the number of progeny, that a vast numbers of animals is needed in a true breeding study, that there is a massive cost associated with an effective study, that rodents have the ability to store epididymal sperm, that male fertility is not FSH dependent, that rodents have seasonality to their estrus cycles, and that there are many uncontrollable variables that affect fertility [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Some of these limitations could be over come by using purpose-bred swine. Other limitations to this study center around the groups not being maintained in the same room and not having the same number of mice. Even with a larger <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> value there would be wide variation in individual response to the vaccines, which can cause a skewed statistical analysis. Thus, it is important to analyze the biological significance of reduced fetal numbers, sperm concentrations, testes volumes, etc. This also highlights the limitations presented by the sparse blood samples taken for comparative analysis. All of these limitations point to the difficulty of breeding studies and the need for planned experiments in the target species (feral swine in the field).</p><p id="p0155">Before field application several aspects of the vaccine candidates need to be experimentally determined. Some of those characteristics include vaccine shedding, the ability of antibodies or the vaccine to cause infertility to meat consumers, the vaccines&#8217; ability to prevent the spread of brucellosis in the field (our laboratories have previously published clearance and protection profiles of the leucine auxotrophic strain of RB51L [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), and oral vaccination efficacy. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> spp. naturally infect hosts via the oral route and therefore theoretically these vaccine candidates can be used as an oral vaccine [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. An oral vaccine bait would be easier and less expensive to produce/deploy in the field, although there are many hurdles to over come [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It would also be important to determine if these vaccine candidates combined with each other (strain RB51LFSH&#946; and RB51LGnRH), hunting, baiting, and/or trapping protocols could reduce feral swine reproduction enough to maintain or decrease the current population. A combination approach seems to be necessary as there is significant literature evidence for the lack of developing a 100% effective feral swine immunocontraceptive vaccine [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p id="p0160">These vaccine candidates could contribute to the effort to control feral swine as mice immunized with strain RB51LGnRH had antibody absorbance values statistically similar to the control mice vaccinated with the Zoetis vaccine, Improvest&#174;. Improvest&#174; has been used effectively worldwide for decades now [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The similarity is also seen in reduced testicular weight, reduced seminiferous tubule diameter, reduced reproduction, and having little to no effect on body weight compared to the controls seen in our data and the Improvest&#174; literature [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is important to remember that the Improvest&#174; label claim states that it suppresses testicular function with no indication for inducing infertility in swine, and it has no indications for mice [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0165">In conclusion, murine sperm production was not reduced by 100% and fertilization did occur, but the vaccines affected the dynamic and essential biological process of reproduction. There are limitations to this study including the murine model, the number of animals, the number of blood draws, antibody and hormone analysis, succinct histopathology analysis, and the fact that the FSH&#946; subunit is swine specific. Despite these limitations, these efforts demonstrate a reduction in fertility characteristics in both males and females, comparable to Improvest&#174; in the literature. Ultimately, the vaccine candidates, <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> RB51LFSH&#946; and <italic toggle="yes">B.&#160;abortus</italic> RB51LGnRH, could provide a more cost-effective oral dual purpose immunocontraceptive brucellosis wildlife vaccine and should be further evaluated as an oral bait in feral swine.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0170">Steven G.
