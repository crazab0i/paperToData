In this study, the safety and efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated in male and female cattle at different ages, and during pregnancy as a part of its registration process. Our data demonstrated that the Flu-BA vaccine was safe after prime or booster vaccination in calves (5&#8211;7 months old male and female), heifers (15&#8211;17 months old) and cows (6&#8211;7 years old) and was not abortogenic in pregnant animals. A mild, localized granuloma was observed at the Flu-BA injection site. Vaccinated animals did not show signs of influenza infection or reduced milk production in dairy cows, and the influenza viral vector (IVV) was not recovered from nasal swabs or milk. Vaccinated animals in all age groups demonstrated increased IgG antibody responses against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> Omp16 and L7/L12 proteins with calves demonstrating the greatest increase in humoral responses. Following experimental challenge with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544, vaccinates demonstrated greater protection and no signs of clinical disease, including abortion, were observed. The vaccine effectiveness against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus 544</italic> infection was 75, 60 and 60%, respectively, in calves, heifers and adult cows. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> were not isolated from calves of vaccinated cattle that were experimentally challenged during pregnancy. Our data suggests that the Flu-BA vaccine is safe and efficacious in cattle, including pregnant animals; and can therefore be administered to cattle of any age.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bovine brucellosis</kwd><kwd>influenza viral vector</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>registration trials</kwd><kwd>protective efficacy</kwd><kwd>calves</kwd><kwd>heifers</kwd><kwd>cows</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="10343"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella abortus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">B. suis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. canis</italic> are all considered to be zoonotic (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">O&#8217;Callaghan and Whatmore, 2011</xref>). Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases of humans, with more than 500,000 cases reported annually. Depending upon the system of controls and the socioeconomic conditions, different countries have reported from 0.09 to 1,603 cases per million inhabitants (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Pappas et&#160;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> is the primary cause of brucellosis of cattle. Because of its impact on human health, in Kazakhstan, regulatory actions for cattle herds infected with brucellosis include quarantine (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Yespembetov et&#160;al., 2019</xref>). In cattle, brucellosis can be manifested by orchitis in males, but clinical signs are primarily in females and include nonviable calves, abortions, retained placentas, and infertility (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">O&#8217;Callaghan and Whatmore, 2011</xref>). Vaccination is an effective tool for controlling brucellosis in livestock (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Garin-Bastuji et&#160;al., 1998</xref>), and is also effective in protecting human health in endemic areas (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zinsstag et&#160;al., 2007</xref>). Currently, brucellosis vaccines for cattle are live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strains (19, 82 and RB51). Although these vaccines have high efficacy for cattle (protection against abortion &gt;70%, complete protection against infection &gt;50%) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Confer et&#160;al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et&#160;al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cheville et&#160;al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cardena et&#160;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ivanov et&#160;al., 2011</xref>), they have a number of serious disadvantages including causing abortions in pregnant animals, virulence in humans, and, with the exception of strain RB51, cause high titers on brucellosis serologic tests that cannot be differentiated from responses of infected animals (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Spink et&#160;al., 1962</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beckett and MacDiarmid, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Ficht, 1990</xref>). Additionally, the strain RB51 is resistant to rifampicin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat brucellosis in humans (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schurig et&#160;al., 1991</xref>). These characteristics of commercial vaccines have limited their wide use in cattle in some countries. Development of an improved brucellosis vaccine for cattle with high efficacy, improved safety characteristics, and the ability to be serologically differentiated from infected animals (DIVA) would be an important advancement.</p><p>Previously, attempts to develop safe and effective <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccines have utilized attenuated mutants (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vemulapalli et&#160;al., 2000a</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Vemulapalli et&#160;al., 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Vemulapalli et&#160;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Olsen et&#160;al., 2009</xref>), subunit (recombinant proteins) vaccines (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tabatabai and Pugh, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et&#160;al., 1994a</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et&#160;al., 1994b</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira and Splitter, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et&#160;al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kurar &amp; Splitter, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Mariri et&#160;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cassataro et&#160;al., 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mallick et&#160;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pasquevich et&#160;al., 2009</xref>), DNA vaccines (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Leclercq et&#160;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">O&#241;ate et&#160;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cassataro et&#160;al., 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Luo et&#160;al., 2006</xref>), RNA vaccine (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">O&#241;ate et&#160;al., 2005</xref>) and vector-based vaccines (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">He et&#160;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cabrera et&#160;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et&#160;al., 2009</xref>).

Influenza viruses were chosen as a vector because of their ability to infect cattle without causing clinical signs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et&#160;al., 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#160;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gunning et&#160;al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Graham et&#160;al., 2002</xref>). The influenza A virus contains a segmented genome consisting of eight negative-strand RNA fragments. Of these, the smallest fragment (NS), encoding two proteins: viral nonstructural protein (NS1) and nuclear export protein (Nep), is a convenient target for genetic manipulation since NS1 tolerates foreign sequences exceeding its own length (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kittel et&#160;al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> constructs encoding 124 amino acids from the N-terminal of the <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> immunodominant L7/L12 and Omp16 proteins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et&#160;al., 1994a</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Tibor et&#160;al., 1999</xref>) were inserted into the NS1 gene of the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) influenza strain. The vectors were constructed using the surface hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins from the A/chicken/Astana/6/05 (H5N1) virus (with removed HA cleavage site) and seasonal &#1040;/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) virus.</p><p>In previous studies, we demonstrated that the IVV based <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> vaccine (Flu-BA) was safe and effective in cattle (including pregnant animals) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016a</xref>), and induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014d</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014e</xref>). Conjunctival or subcutaneous vaccination of pregnant heifers induced protection against infection after <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 challenge in 70&#8211;80% and prevented abortions in 80-90% of animals that was comparable to protection after vaccination with <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014e</xref>). Simultaneous conjunctival and subcutaneous vaccination with Flu-BA vaccine induced 100% protection against abortion and 88.8 to 100% protection against infection after <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 challenge which was greater than protection by a commercial <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> strain S19 vaccine (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016b</xref>). As the Flu-BA vaccine does not form <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> lipopolysaccharide, no antibodies are induced in vaccinated cattle thereby meeting the DIVA criteria (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016a</xref>).

In this study, we examined the safety and efficacy of the Flu-BA vaccine compared simultaneously in different age groups of cattle, including pregnant animals. These studies were carried out as part of the Flu-BA vaccine registration trial in Kazakhstan, and therefore they were carried out according to the requirements and supervision of the regulatory body with the involvement of leading experts in this field. At the request of the Regulatory Body, this study not only required confirmation of the previously stated properties of the vaccine on cattle, but also disclosure of the properties of the vaccine described in this paper. In particular, it was necessary to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine in young cattle (from 4 months of age). This was because all known commercial brucellosis vaccines (<italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 and RB51) have been in use in young animals as per manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. It was also interesting to study the effectiveness of the vaccine in bulls. This requirement was justified by the fact that bulls with brucellosis are able to spread the infection through semen since the organisms predominantly infect testicle (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gemechu, 2017</xref>), although in general they do not play a significant role in epidemiology of the disease. Another important interest was study of the degree of development of influenza infection in cattle vaccinated with IVV, which in this case was used as a carrier to deliver foreign genes into the host cells. This interest was because influenza A viruses in sporadic cases infect cattle and cause signs of influenza infection (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et&#160;al., 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#160;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gunning et&#160;al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Graham et&#160;al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In the first series of studies, we comparatively investigated the safety of Flu-BA vaccine in different age groups of cattle (including pregnant ones), assessing both general and local adverse events. Overall, studies have shown that the tested vaccine formulation (IVV suspension subtype H5N1 or H1N1-stabilizing media-adjuvant), regardless of age and pregnancy status of the cattle, is completely safe and not abortogenic (in both pregnant heifers and adult cows). The only aspect is that the vaccine was not devoid of local adverse effects, which was characterized by the formation of infiltrates in the area of injection. This was due to use of the polymeric adjuvant Montanide Gel01 as the control group of animals received only that adjuvant had an identical reaction. It is noteworthy to mention here that in this study we showed for the first time the dynamics of formation and complete resorption of subcutaneous infiltrates in cattle after prime and booster vaccination. Based on the results of these studies, we were unable to identify any logical dependence of this indicator on the age status of cattle. The only thing that was obvious is that after prime and booster vaccination, the largest infiltrates was observed in the experimental group of cows. At the same time, there was no difference in the time of complete resorption of infiltrates between the groups. Complete resorption of infiltrates in all age groups of cattle took place within 35 days after each vaccination, which is fully consistent with the Flu-BA vaccine instructions. Despite the fact that the described local adverse effect of the Montanide Gel01 adjuvant, its use in the vaccine formulation (as a diluent) to increase the effectiveness of the preparation is fully justified. In general, the results are fully consistent with our previous studies (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Separate attention was given to the safety aspects of the vaccine as IVV used may cause influenza infection in cattle upon Flu-BA vaccination. Cattle are generally not susceptible to influenza type A virus, but there are reports of sporadic outbreaks of human influenza virus (strains A/Eng/333/80 H1N1 and A/Eng/427/88 H3N2) infection in dairy cows (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Gunning et&#160;al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Graham et&#160;al., 2002</xref>). Clinical manifestation of the infection was expressed by virus in the nose, but most often by a dramatic fall in milk yield, which was recovered only 1&#8211;2 weeks after the infection. Retrospective analysis of cow serum samples in infected herds showed HAI antibodies to influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3 in about 50% of animals with the titer 1:10&#8211;1:640 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Graham et&#160;al., 2002</xref>). In our studies, no age dependent including in lactating pregnant animals any influenza signs after prime and booster vaccination with Flu-BA. No loss or significant decrease in milk production was observed in dairy cattle after vaccination. Moreover, vaccine viruses were not detected in nasal swabs and milk of vaccinated animals. We attribute this to the subcutaneous method of vaccination and secondly to the limited replication ability of IVV due to truncated interferon antagonist NS1 protein (replacing polybasic cleavage site with a trypsin-dependent sequence in IVV subtype H5). The only response of all age groups of cattle to the IVV vaccination was the formation of IgG antibodies to the influenza A virus, and in calves the formation of HAI antibodies to the influenza virus subtypes H5 and H1 was predominant. Based on results of these studies we conclude that Flu-BA vaccine does not cause influenza signs of infection and it is safe for use in cattle.</p><p>We then experimentally confirmed Flu-BA&#8217;s compliance with the DIVA criteria by examining serum of cattle vaccinated by using routine serologic brucellosis diagnostic tests&#8212;RBT, SAT and ELISA. As expected, animals vaccinated with Flu-BA vaccine reacted negatively in these tests. This is due to the fact that all brucellosis diagnostic tests are mainly aimed at detecting <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> anti-OPS antibodies, while IVV, expressing <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> Omp16 and L7/L12 proteins failed to react. The results obtained are fully consistent with our previous studies (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016a</xref>). Thus, Flu-BA vaccine meets the important criteria of DIVA, which in turn allows for a successful vaccination campaign.</p><p>Another research blog was devoted to study of the antibody response to Flu-BA vaccine in different age groups of cattle. It should be noted that, unlike the previous studies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a antibodies; lymphocyte stimulation index, gamma interferon production) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014d</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016c</xref>), here the study of vaccine immunogenicity was limited to the detection of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigen-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA. This was because Flu-BA vaccine guidelines stated that the only way to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness on both model animals (mice and guinea pigs) and cattle is through the challenge method. Therefore, detailed immunogenicity testing in animals was not required by the regulatory body. Our data showed that in all age groups of cattle for 28 days after prime and booster vaccination IgG antibodies to both individual proteins Omp16 and L7/L12 and their mixtures were significantly increased. This fact in itself indirectly indicates the expression of these <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> proteins in the body of vaccinated animals, as well as the absence of interference between two IVVs expressing different <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> proteins. It is noteworthy to mention that among different age groups of cattle the highest induction of antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> proteins after both prime and booster vaccination was observed in calves. Interestingly, these data are consistent with results of the antibody response to IVV, where the better induction of HAI antibodies were demonstrated in calves. It is important to note that after booster vaccination all experimental cattle had a slight increase in the level of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> antigen-specific IgG antibodies compared to after prime vaccination. This fact suggests that a cross-immunization scheme is justified to overcome the immune background to the viral vector, IVV with different subtypes of hemagglutinin were used (H5 for prime, H1 for booster vaccination).</p><p>The final and defining phase of work was to test Flu-BA vaccine protection in different age groups of cattle. The protection level of vaccinated animals against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection was assessed based on clinical observation (temperature response, monitoring of abortions) and bacteriological studies. The latter method allows not only the presence/absence of the pathogen in infected animal but also shows the degree of incidence (infection index) and intensity (the level of colonization of brucellosis from tissues) of brucellosis infection. The results of the studies showed that prime-booster subcutaneous immunization of cattle with Flu-BA vaccine provides complete protection against clinical manifestation of brucellosis infection; and the vaccinated pregnant heifers did not abort and the cows gave birth to healthy calves during the period of observation. All animals, both in the experimental and control groups, after challenge infection responded positively to brucellosis in RBA, SAT, ELISA, as well as in the milk ring test (dairy cows). It is interesting to note that in the milk of vaccinated cows antibodies in the ring test were formed significantly earlier (4.6 &#177; 0.5 <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 8.6 &#177; 2.0 days after challenge) than in the control group. In our opinion, this is one of the evidence of a rapid immune response to the infectious agent in animals because of vaccination.</p><p>Bacteriological analysis of Flu-BA vaccine protection has shown that it provides 75% effectiveness against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection in immunized calves, including bulls, as well as 60% effectiveness in heifers and cows, including pregnant animals. Here, we showed that Flu-BA vaccine is more effective in calves than adult animals based on the immunogenicity data. Likewise, susceptibility of calves to brucellosis infection, including bulls, was significantly lower than that of heifers and cows. This is despite the fact that in all age groups of cattle the same dose of virulent strain <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 was used. In general, the low susceptibility of young cattle to brucellosis can also be explained by the presence of bulls in this group of cattle, which are less susceptible than female cattle and in them brucellosis is predominantly manifested in the form of orchitis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gemechu, 2017</xref>). It is important to note that the vaccinated bulls, unlike the control group, do not have <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in their testicles after challenge. These preliminary results indicate that the immunization of bulls with Flu-BA vaccine not only protects against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection, but also has the potential to prevent the spread of the pathogen through semen. With regard to heifers and cows, including pregnant ones, it can be noted that brucellosis infection was relatively rapid in these groups, with a high index of infection and <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization from tissues, as well as 100% abortions in pregnant cows. Therefore, the vaccination efficacy in heifers and cows was slightly lower than in calves. The level of effectiveness achieved in heifers and cows (60%) is comparable to previous studies (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2014e</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016c</xref>), where the efficacy under similar conditions was in the range of 70&#8211;80%, and to the commercial RB-51 vaccine (50%) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2016c</xref>). In general, there were no significant differences between vaccinated calves, heifers and cows in terms of the index of infection and degree of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> colonization in tissues. Thus, it can be concluded that Flu-BA vaccine is safe and effective in all age groups of cattle, and fully meets the requirements of regulatory documentation.</p><p>Based on results of this study, Flu-BA vaccine has been successfully tested on target animals, confirmed as previously stated (according to the instructions for use), and demonstrated new (at the request of the regulatory body) properties of the vaccine in cattle. The results of this study conducted in conjunction with other studies for compliance with the preparations specifications (physico-chemical and biological properties), made it possible to register it in the State Register of Veterinary Preparations and Feed Additives of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan (registration certificate No. RK-VP-1-3775-19 dated January 14, 2019). In spite of relatively short period of 6 years of complex research, we managed to develop not only a novel vaccine candidate but also thoroughly studied its properties in the target animals; most importantly, introduced for field use in cattle of all age and pregnancy status. The high importance of this work is the fact that Flu-BA is the first vaccine introduced in the last two decades after commercial <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB-51 vaccine. The main advantages of this vaccine in comparison with commercial vaccine was that our study eventually led to its registration in Kazakhstan (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov, 2016</xref>). It is obvious that Flu-BA vaccine by safety profile (absence of any temperature reaction, abortions, persistence of vaccine viruses in nose and shedding through milk) significantly exceeds all known commercial brucellosis vaccines. In addition, it does not present any serious risk to human health (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ferko et&#160;al., 2004</xref>) unlike other commercial <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Spink et&#160;al., 1962</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beckett and MacDiarmid, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schurig et&#160;al., 1991</xref>). This is evidenced by the fact that research is currently under way using IVV platform to develop a brucellosis vaccine for humans (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bugybayeva et&#160;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bugybayeva et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). Another important advantage of Flu-BA vaccine is that it is in line with the DIVA strategy, which allowed <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB-51 to virtually replace the earlier <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 vaccine from the market. Commercial vaccines, <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 and RB51 (according to their application instructions), do not differ significantly from Flu-BA in their basic immunobiological properties (timing and duration of the protective immune response, effectiveness of vaccine and expiration date). Although, in contrast to <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB51 vaccine with lack of information, our vaccine product is capable of providing cross-protection in vaccinated cattle against <italic toggle="yes">B. melitensis</italic> infection (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tabynov et&#160;al., 2015</xref>). This feature of the vaccine is particularly critical in developing and under developed <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> endemic countries wherein small ruminants and cattle are reared together. Flu-BA is significantly more expensive than <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> S19 (almost four times), although it is almost three times cheaper than the most common and most popular <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> RB-51 vaccine. We hope that the combination of these benefits of Flu-BA vaccine, which meets most of the criteria for &#8220;ideal brucellosis vaccine&#8221; as defined by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ko and Splitter (2003)</xref> will eventually allow it to gain a foothold in the veterinary market. Currently, Flu-BA vaccine is undergoing post-registration testing (field trials) at the initiative of the manufacturer; in particular, it is used to recover several livestock farms in Kazakhstan with different levels of prevalence of brucellosis infection. If successful at this stage, large-scale production and use of this vaccine is planned in Kazakhstan, and possibly in other countries.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our trials of Flu-BA vaccine in different age groups of cattle, including pregnant cattle upon prime and booster subcutaneous immunization showed complete safety profile and not abortogenic. But it exhibits moderate local adverse events in the form of development of infiltrates at the injection site, which completely gets resorbed within 35 days after vaccination. Furthermore, the vaccine did not cause any signs of influenza infection, reduction or loss of milk production in dairy cattle and absence of persistence of IVV in vaccinated animals in nose and milk. It does not elicit antibodies that respond positively to routine serologic brucellosis diagnostic tests, and therefore meets the DIVA criterion. The vaccine induces specific antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> Omp16 and L7/L12 proteins, with the highest response in calves. Flu-BA vaccine provides full protection against clinical manifestations of brucellosis, including abortion, and 75, 60 and 60% effectiveness against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection in immunized calves (including bulls), heifers and cows (including pregnant ones). The vaccine provides 100% protection against <italic toggle="yes">B. abortus</italic> 544 infection of calves from immunized pregnant cows. To conclude the Flu-BA vaccine has now passed the registration commission tests of safety and protection on different age groups of cattle, including pregnant animals, and was therefore recommended for practical use in all age group of cattle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
