      <abstract>
        <p>In Cambodia, goat production and meat consumption are customary among Muslim communities. Recently, goat meat has gained popularity among Cambodians. Goat farmers use a traditional management system, including grazing, requiring minimal labour. The close proximity between humans and animals could increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. A serological survey was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of some priority zoonoses and high-impact animal diseases in the Cambodian goat population. A total of 540 samples were collected from goats in six provinces and analysed with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> species, Q fever (C<italic toggle="yes">oxiella burnetii</italic>), Foot and Mouth Disease virus non-structural protein (FMDV NSP) and Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV). True seroprevalences with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI), taking into account imperfect tests, risk factors and odds ratios (ORs), were calculated to better understand the disease distribution and epidemiology. Independent variables used in statistical modellings included sex, body condition score, age, vaccination history, province and commune, while dependent variables were ELISA test results. The overall true prevalence of antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>., <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic>, FMDV and PPRV, were 0.1% (95% CI 0.0, 1.0), 7.2% (95% CI 5.3, 9.7), 57.7% (95% CI 53.1, 62.3) and 0.0% (95% CI 0.0, 0.0), respectively. There was no identified risk factor for brucellosis and PPR. The two risk factors for <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seropositivity were sex (p-value = 0.0005) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001). However, only the OR of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seropositive female goat was significant at 9.7 (95% CI 2.7, 35.5) times higher than male. The risk factors of FMD NSP seropositivity were age (p-value = 0.001) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001). Only the age &#x2019;more than two-year-old&#x2019; group with a significant OR of 6.2 (95% CI 2.1, 18.4) using the &#x2019;up to one-year-old&#x2019; group as the reference. In summary, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. seroprevalence was low, while no evidence of PPRV antibodies was detected in the goat populations. <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence in female goats was significantly higher than for males, and there were significant differences in <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence between communes. The overall FMDV NSP seroprevalence was high, especially in older animals. Vaccination should be advocated to protect animals from FMDV and improve productivity. As the impacts of these zoonoses on human and animal health were still unknown, further investigation of these zoonotic diseases&#x2019; epidemiology is recommended.</p>

        <title>Author summary</title>
        <p>Goat production and meat consumption are growing in Cambodia. Smallholders often keep goats in a housing area within their households, increasing contact between animals and humans and, thereby, the risk for zoonotic disease transmission. This study collected 540 goat samples applying the two-stage survey method, where the communes were the sampling frame and villages were clustered and tested for antibodies against <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>., <italic toggle="yes">Coxiella burnetii</italic> (Q fever), Foot and mouth disease virus non-structural protein (FMDV NSP), and Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The overall apparent seroprevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic>, FMDV NSP and PPRV were 0.4%,7.2%, 53.3% and 0.9% (n = 540), respectively. The only two brucella-positive samples were from Kampot and Tboung Khmum provinces. Moreover, Kandal province (22.2%, N = 90) and Dei Edth commune (36.7%, N = 30) had the highest <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence compared to the others. Although seroprevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. detected in our study was low, while <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence in some studied areas was relatively high, and the impacts of both zoonoses on animal and human health remain unknown. Seroprevalence of FMDV NSF was also high and widely distributed. Thus, future investigations targeting high-risk areas would be recommended to understand better the disease epidemiologies and their impacts on human and animal health.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In 2018, the total number of goats in Cambodia reported by the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP) was 25,747 head [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is a strong cultural demand for sheep and goat meat in the country, and the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) reported that in 2019, Cambodia imported around $2.9 million worth of sheep and goat meat, while there was virtually no export of this meat [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some government and international organisations have given goats to farmers to boost household incomes [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While goats provide meat for family consumption, they are also considered an additional source of income for the family. Cambodian farmers raise goats using a traditional management system of releasing them for grazing during the daytime and housing them at night [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Goats are commonly kept for consumption by the Cham Muslim minority. However, recently, goat meat has been increasingly consumed by other Cambodians [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and there is an emerging market opportunity for goat meat in the country, as local production of other meat (beef, pork, chicken and duck) is still in short supply [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Goat production can help improve small farmers&#x2019; livelihoods and provide alternative red meat for Cambodians.</p>
      <p>Livestock health is directly related to human health. Animal production could increase the risks of zoonotic disease transmission, especially in low-resource environments where disease surveillance and response systems are not well established [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Smallholders usually keep their livestock within their households, which allows close contact between humans and animals. Moreover, One Health pathogens reported in goats in neighbouring countries that could impact Cambodian goat farmers include <italic toggle="yes">Coxiella burnetii</italic> (Q fever), <italic toggle="yes">Brucella melitensis</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], endoparasite [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and protozoan [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] infections. Other high-impact animal diseases, including Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and orf infection [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], were also reported. Some of these diseases are considered endemic in Cambodia. However, available information on goat population, management, health and production in Cambodia is limited [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies of Cambodian goats mainly focused on forages, nutrition, and parasite burdens and control [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. There were no publications on goat disease surveillance programs at the time of our study. Thus, this study&#x2019;s main objectives were to enhance the animal disease diagnostic capacity through practising, estimate the prevalence of priority diseases in Cambodian goats (including FMD, brucellosis and Q fever), and provide scientific evidence of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) freedom. The outcomes of this study will contribute to future disease control and prevention programs which would help improve goat productivity and national food security, as well as provide information to inform public health about potential zoonosis exposure in the human population.</p>

        <p>Goat populations in 2018 reported the by General Directorate of Animal Health and Production (GDAHP) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were used as baseline information (<xref rid="pntd.0011244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A phone interview with all 25 Cambodian veterinary provincial chiefs in late 2019 revealed that only nine provinces, namely Kandal, Takeo, Kampot, Tboung Khmum, Prey Veng, Phnom Penh, Kampong Chhnang, Siem Reap and Battambang, raised goats. The remaining provinces reported that farmers no longer raised goats or had no goat production in the area. The selection criteria of the targeted provinces and districts were based on 1) high numbers of goats and 2) high activity of goat meat consumption, while communes and villages were randomly selected.</p>

        <p>Six provinces, comprising Kandal, Takeo, Kampot, Tbung Khmum, Prey Veng and Phnom Penh, were selected for this study. Although there was a high population of goats in Battambang in 2018, the phone assessment indicated a significant reduction in numbers. The Epitools ("2-Stage surveys for demonstration of freedom") [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was used to calculate the sample size. The two-stage sample size calculation used communes as the sampling frame and villages as clusters. The parameters used for the sample size calculation included a survey system sensitivity of 95%, unit-level design prevalence of 10%, cluster-level design prevalence of 1%, test sensitivity of 95% (based on the ELISA test sensitivity used), and target cluster sensitivity of 95%.</p>
        <p>The numbers of goats kept in those randomly selected villages ranging from 20 to 200 (except a village with 350 goats) were used in the calculation. Thus, the sample size of 30 goats per village (cluster) was selected for this study. For those villages with less than 30 goats, all goats were to be sampled. However, some randomly selected villages had no goats during the sample collection period. Thus, some communes and villages included in this study were based on available goat population and convenient access to replace those without goats. Locations of the study sites are shown in <xref rid="pntd.0011244.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and visualised in <xref rid="pntd.0011244.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Sample collection and transportation</title>
        <p>Animal information, including age, sex, vaccination history and body condition score (BCS), was collected using a sample collection form accompanying animal specimens. The BCS used for our study was the score 1 (lean) to 5 (fat). A blood sample was collected from the jugular vein of the goat and transferred to a sterile with no anticoagulant (red-top) tube. The tube was labelled with a unique identification number using a permanent marker and placed in a rack inside a large zip-lock plastic bag. The samples were kept in a cooler with ice packs when transported back to the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute (NAHPRI) laboratory. Serum was separated from whole blood at NAHPRI using a refrigerated centrifuge (Thermo Scientific, Germany) at 1000&#x2013;2000 x g for 10 minutes and stored in an -30&#xB0;C Freezer until tested.</p>

Laboratory testing was conducted at NAHPRI based on the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, and results were determined by an ELISA microplate reader (Infinite F50, Singapore). The ID soft software version 5.05 [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provided by the manufacturer was used for the calculation of the test sample percentage of positive control (S/P%) or the test sample percentage of negative control (S/N%), depending on the test. The diagnostic test sensitivity (Dse), specificity (Dsp) and the cutoff of the S/P% for FMDV NSP, brucellosis and Q fever ELISAs were previously reported by Siengsanan-Lamont [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For the PPRV ELISA test, the competition percentage (S/N%) was calculated, and the cutoff was applied as recommended by the manufacturer, i.e. S/N% &#x2264; 50% = positive, 50%&lt; S/N% &#x2264;60% = doubtful, S/N% &gt; 60% = negative. An earlier study reported a Dsp of 97.1% and a Dse of 96.4% sensitivity for the PPRV ELISA [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
        <p>Descriptive and statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel and R studio version 4.1.0 [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (R Core Team, 2021). Apparent and true prevalence with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated, taking into account an imperfect test using the EpiR package, Wilson method [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Seroprevalence maps were produced using the R leaflet package [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Univariate analyses (Fisher Exact and Chi-squared tests) were used to identify associations between the variables and test results [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The independent variables used in modelling included sex, BCS, age, vaccination history, province, and commune, while the dependent variables were test results. Subsets of variables with a p-value less than 0.1 were included in multivariate logistic regression modelling [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The final model contained significant variables (p-value &lt; 0.05) by the analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-squared test, smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) among fitted models [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], no multicollinearity (variance inflation factor (VIF) &lt;10) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and passed the Hosmer-Lemeshow, goodness of fit test [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

        <p>A total of 540 goat samples were collected from nineteen villages within eighteen communes and districts due to one village having a small number of goats (<xref rid="pntd.0011244.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The plot of age (month) versus the sex variable is shown in <xref rid="pntd.0011244.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. Animal ages were then grouped into three groups, as described in <xref rid="pntd.0011244.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, for statistical analyses and model-fitting purposes. More than 70% (381/540) of the samples were from female goats, while approximately 68% (368/540) were aged &#x2019;up to one-year-old&#x2019; (<xref rid="pntd.0011244.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Based on BCS scoring 1 to 5, 64.3% (347/540) were from animals with a BCS of 3. However, only 22.2% (120/540) were vaccinated against FMDV or both FMDV and haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS). All FMDV-vaccinated animals (n = 30) were from Angkor Borei village, while the FMDV and HS-vaccinated animals were from three villages [Chrouy Changvar (n = 30), Kampong Ompil (n = 30) and Ang Riem(n = 30)]. The overall true seroprevalence of FMDV NSP, <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> were 57.7%, 0.1% and 7.2% (n = 540), respectively.

        <p>For FMDV NSP (<xref rid="pntd.0011244.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), risk factors identified by univariate analyses were age (p-value = 0.001), vaccination history (p-value &lt;0.0001), province (p-value &lt;0.0001) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001). These variables were included in the multivariate logistic regression modelling where the final model contained only age (p-value = 0.001) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001). Compared to the &#x2019;up-to-one-year&#x2019; age group, the &#x2019;more than two-years-old&#x2019; group had a significantly higher FMDV NSP seropositivity (OR = 6.2, 95%CI 2.1, 18.4). The significant factors identified by univariate analyses for C. burnetii were sex (p-value = 0.004), province (p-value &lt;0.0001) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001). Only sex (p-value = 0.0005) and commune (p-value &lt;0.0001) remained in the final multivariate model. However, only the OR of female goats (9.7 (95% CI 2.7, 35.5)) compared to males was significant, while all ORs of communes were not significant.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A report on the goat population between 1998 and 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) demonstrated no goat raising or meat production in Cambodia [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, a study in 2004 funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) claimed the Cambodian goat population was approximately 5000 head [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As the GDAPH official report [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] on goat populations in 2018 was not up to date, data obtained from the 2019 phone interview was used for the sample size calculation. Despite the 2018 government report (<xref rid="pntd.0011244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) showing that almost all provinces had goats, the phone interview confirmed that only nine provinces still had goats. Goats kept by Cambodian households were classified into three groups: smallholders with 3&#x2013;10 goats, medium with 10&#x2013;49 goats and large with more than 49 goats [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with an average number of goats per household of 21.5 [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The numbers of goats in the randomly selected village (between 20&#x2013;200 goats) derived from the phone interview were used for the sample size calculation with a target of 30 samples per village. However, the sample collections conducted about a year after the phone interview revealed that the goat populations were again drastically changed and did not represent the 2020 goat distribution. Thus, not all communes and villages included in the study were randomly selected. The parameters used for the sample size calculation were selected according to the Dse of the kit (for test sensitivity) and a level of confidence at 95% (for survey system and cluster sensitivities). As for the design prevalences, the unit-level prevalence of 10% and the cluster-level prevalence of 1% were sufficient to detect disease evidence in the target population. Moreover, due to limited resources, our study did not include Kampong Chhnang and the north-western provinces (Battambong and Siem Reap), even though significant goat populations were confirmed. It is recommended that future programs should include these areas, especially as these provinces are in close proximity to neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>Our data revealed that almost half of the sampled goats were females aged less than or equal to 12 months. Goats are generally sold for meat aged between 3 and 5 months (11&#x2013;23 kg) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, goats reach a breeding age between 5 and 13 months of age [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A study in Vietnam also reported that goat farmers commonly kept one male for breeding and sold other males at a live weight of 25&#x2013;30 kgs [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This practice may explain the lower numbers of males in almost all age-month groups compared to females (except for the 6-month group) in our study. Despite the traditional management (mainly grazing) being common practice and most animals in our study being unvaccinated, most animals had a BCS of 3, considered to indicate adequate nutrition (not too thin or too fat). Only four (in Takeo and Phnom Penh provinces) of 18 villages vaccinated their goats against FMDV or FMDV/HS. It was unclear why the vaccines were only used in limited areas.</p>
      <p>Seroprevalence of brucellosis in Cambodian goats was lower than those of studies in goats in Lao PDR (1.4%, n = 1458) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (Burns et al., 2018) and Thailand (1.4%, n = 94722) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence of goats in Cambodia was higher than those reported in Lao PDR (4.1%, n = 1458) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (Burns et al., 2018) and Thailand (3.5%, n = 516) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While for cattle, seroprevalences of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> in Cambodia (n = 477) were 0.2% and 0.8%, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For FMDV NSP, surprisingly, Cambodian goats in our study had a much higher seroprevalence (57.7%) than Lao PDR goats (13.0%, n = 591) [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A study reported that 11.1% of the goat population in outbreak subdistricts in Thailand was affected by FMD [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In conclusion, the seroprevalence of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella spp</italic>. in Cambodian ruminants was relatively low. Further investigation of brucellosis in the areas where seropositive animals were detected would be useful for future disease control.</p>
      <p>The seroprevalence of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> in female goats was significantly higher than in males. <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Burnetii</italic> causes reproductive losses (abortion and stillborn) in females where the bacteria are highly concentrated in the body and amniotic fluids of aborting animals. As most male goats in our study were age less than or up to 12 months old, they may be less likely to be exposed to the bacteria during their lifetime compared to older female goats. As <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">burnetii</italic> seroprevalence in Cambodian goats was higher than in other animals and in the neighbouring countries [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and it is a One Health pathogen, the disease&#x2019;s impacts on animal and human health should be further investigated.</p>
      <p>Purified FMDV vaccines are free from cellular proteins and NSP. Thus, antibodies against FMDV NSP are only present in animals previously exposed to FMDV (natural infection). However, the FMDV NSP antibodies can also be detected if NSP-contaminated vaccines have been used. FMD seroprevalence in the &#x2019;1 to 2-year-old&#x2019; group is a good indication of the endemic nature of the disease, as this group is unlikely to have received multiple vaccinations or have maternally derived antibodies. However, for this age group, a seroprevalence of 42.7% is very high in our study. The highest FMDV NSP seroprevalence was the &#x2019;more than two years old&#x2019; group, followed by the &#x2019;up to one-year-old&#x2019; group. This may be due to the older the animals are, the more likely the animals are to be vaccinated multiple times (increasing chances of exposure to an unpurified vaccine) or exposed to FMD viruses, as FMD is endemic in Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The vaccination history was also a risk factor for FMDV NSP seropositivity in this study. However, the seroprevalence of FMDV-vaccinated animals was much higher than those of unvaccinated and of FMDV/HS-vaccinated groups. However, all FMDV-vaccinated animals were from one village. Thus, it is likely that the village had been affected by an FMD outbreak. Communes were an FMD risk factor as all samples from some communes tested positive. In contrast, some other communes had low or no positive samples, which resulted in significant differences in FMDV seropositivity between communes. Goats in our study had a higher FMDV seroprevalence than other species in the country [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and those in neighbouring countries [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Future studies investigating risk and protective factors within the communes would help support FMD control and prevention.</p>
      <p>Our study revealed that PPRV true seroprevalence and 95% CIs were zero or approaching zero. PPR is a severe viral disease with morbidity and mortality rates of up to 90% and 40%, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As there was no previous report of PPR in the country prior to the time of this study, our study provided scientific evidence to support PPR freedom. However, Thailand reported the first detection of PPR in goats imported from West Africa on February 2021 [<xref rid="pntd.0011244.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. More studies should be conducted to monitor the extent of the PPR introduction to the Southeast Asia region.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, knowledge of diseases and their epidemiology is key to maximise goat productivity and protect human health. Some of the pathogens appear to be circulating in the population based on the seroprevalence results, except PPR. As the seroprevalence of FMDV NSP was high, and most goats in our study were not vaccinated, the use of vaccination which will help reduce losses and increase productivity, should be advocated. Seroprevalences of the two zoonoses, brucellosis and Q fever, were relatively low, although further investigation would help better understand the epidemiology and human health impacts of both neglected zoonotic diseases.</p>

      <p>***********************</p>
      <p>In this manuscript, Siengsanan-Lamont and co-authors describe the seroprevalence of antibodies against a variety of pathogens in goats in Cambodia. The reviewers felt that the study was largely well conducted and solid scientifically. There were a number of points they raised that need to be addressed prior to publication: </p>
      <p>- There is not sufficient description of study limitation in the Discussion section.</p>
      <p>- The Methods are lacking some key details about the ELISAs used in the study, such as the sensitivity and specificity and the specific antigenic targets.</p>
      <p>- The authors should describe seroprevalence in terms of antibodies against the pathogens, not in terms of disease (e.g. PPRV not PPR; C. burnetii not Q fever; etc).</p>
      <p>- The authors should address any impact of FMDV vaccination on the results.</p>
      <p>- The Abstract is much longer than it needs to be. I would put this one as optional, but I think it would be a stronger publication if the Abstract were more concise and clearer. I would say the same about the Author Summary.</p>
      <p>- The Methods do not describe how the specific goat herds were selected, and I don't believe there was any statistical adjustment for clustering.</p>
      <p>- Data availability, per PLOS policy, is not sufficiently addressed. There is no compelling statement on why these data can't be shared, and just mentioning to ask a government agency without even providing contact information does not address the requirement. </p>
      <p>Reviewer 1 also had a number of relevant and substantive comments in a MS Word attachment. Please make sure you address these as well - they should be considered carefully in your modifications. </p>
      <p>Some other minor comments:</p>
      <p>- Abstract, line 32: "odds" in "odds ratios" does not need to be capitalized, and probably best described as "calculated" or "estimated" not "identified"</p>
      <p>- Abstract, line 35: Looks like there is a typo in the confidence interval for FMD NSP.</p>
      <p>- Abstract: I don't understand this statement "Q fever seroprevalence of female goats was significantly higher than males; however, it may be due to an imbalance between male and female populations." What "imbalance"? Would this have been addressed by statistical adjustments?</p>
      <p>- Abstract: Why is FMD identified by the NSP when the other pathogens the antigen is not mentioned?</p>
      <p>- Author Summary, lines 59-60: The framing of "true seroprevalence" is confusing. </p>
      <p>- Similarly in the Results, line 180: How can a true prevalence be "less than zero"? I think that's part of the problem I have with this interpretation. So, the assumption is that the few positives are false-positives, which may very well be true, it's just hard to accept outright that the 95% CI is bounded by 0.0 when there were samples that tested positive.</p>
      <p>- Discussion, line 277: "Our study provided scientific evidence to support PPR freedom." Is this meant to convey that they study supports the idea that these regions are free of PPRV? I understand that the tool you used is not sufficiently specific, but then those 5 positives need to be better characterized if you are trying to demonstrate absence. I think it's fair say that PPRV is low to non-existent but more specific assays are needed, or something less concrete that is consistent with the data.</p>
      <p>- Discussion, lines 268-271: The statement about the future of goat production is unrelated to the current study. I recommend you keep your final conclusions tied to the current study.</p>
      <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
      <p>
<bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
</p>
      <p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p>
      <p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p>
      <p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p>
      <p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p>
      <p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p>
      <p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p>
      <p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p>
      <p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: The objective is clearly stated, and the study design, while in need of more information, is appropriate. Population and sample size are well described, and while I am no statistician, it seems like the statistical analysis has been done correctly. I have attached a word document with more comments.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: This is a well-conducted study with clear results which are well reported. There are no obvious scientific flaws in the work.</p>
      <p>Line 136-7. Centrifugal force should always be expressed as "x g", not "revolutions per minute", as the force will vary according to the diameter of the centrifuge rotor as well as the rotational speed.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3: The objective of the study is clearly articulated. The study design is appropriate to address the stated objectives. The study population is clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested. The sample size is sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested. The statistical analyses used are inadequate to support conclusions. Ethical and regulatory requirements have been met.</p>
      <p>L116-117: Are you demonstrating sero-prevalence of the diseases or freedom from the diseases/ the two objectives result in very different sample sizes. Also, you were investigating four diseases. The limits of the parameters used for sample size calculation were for which lead disease and tests? And why?</p>
      <p>It is better if the figures and the table are separated by the sections of text on pg. 3 as appropriate. For instance, have Figure 1 immediately after explaining what it is about, then continue with text and place the table and Figure 2 after the second bit of text.</p>
      <p>L117-118: It is not clear what this sentence means. Also state clearly what your sampling method was;</p>
      <p>L116-122: Give the formula that Epitools utilized and explain the parameters in the formula followed by the limits you used (which you have described) and why. Give citations/references as well;</p>
      <p>L121-122&#x2026;.sample size of 30 goats per village was calculated&#x2026;.But then according to Table 1, some villages had sample sizes &lt;30;</p>
      <p>L122-123: place this sentence in the results section;</p>
      <p>L135: But direct contact with icepacks could cause haemolysis of whole blood. How did you prevent this?;</p>
      <p>L154: These cutoffs have some overlap;</p>
      <p>L155: These parameters/limits are more important in the section where you calculate the sample size;</p>
      <p>L157/58: Give the formula used, the parameters used and their limits, why and the appropriate references. As in 116-122, even if a tool is used, there is an underlying formula;</p>
      <p>L163: Given that you have more or less used cluster sampling technique, A Generalized Linear Mixed regression Model (GLMM) would have been more appropriate for your analysis so as to include random and fixed effects;</p>
      <p>In Figure 2, show where Cambodia is located globally then zoom out the study areas, making clear the link between the names in the legend and those in the map and text;</p>
      <p>--------------------</p>
      <p>
<bold>Results</bold>
</p>
      <p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p>
      <p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p>
      <p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: The results are a bit difficult to follow and I therefore recommend that the authors separate them by pathogen. In general the figures are good, but I am missing a table that presents results from the predictor variable analysis (it might just be that I missed it, in which case I do apologize). I have attached a word document with more comments.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: Yes, with the exception of Table 1 which I found unclear as to which "Districts/Municipalities" belonged to which "Province". Maybe the demarcations should be clearer with the Province" name at the very top of the column.</p>
      <p>Line 180. The true prevalence cannot be "less than zero" ! It is zero.</p>
      <p>I wonder if Figure 4 (%Brucellosis seroprevalence) has any validity with only 2 positive samples in the whole study ! I would leave it out of the paper.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3: You could present results on herd structure (age, sex) and husbandry characteristics (vaccination, grazing) of the study animals before presenting the test results) to justify some of the discussions in the discussion section;</p>
      <p>Instead of n=540; n=30, you should indicate how many out of the total i.e. the fraction forming the percentage e.g. 70% (378/540) in L172;</p>
      <p>L172/73: Say &#x2026;more than 70% of samples were from female animals;</p>
      <p>You can break the narrative at line 181, present the table and proceed; </p>
      <p>L182: Figure 3 is not about sero-prevalence in the provinces. Correct and place the figure after L182;</p>
      <p>Present Figure 4 at line 187 and mention it in the text;</p>
      <p>L196: Rephrase to avoid two brackets into each other;</p>
      <p>L236: Retain the citation format prescribed by the journal, throughout the manuscript;</p>
      <p>Where the p values are very small, e.g. 8.0x10-7 in L189 etc., indicate them as p&lt;0.001</p>

<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p>
      <p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p>
      <p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p>
      <p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p>
      <p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: The conclusions are in general supported by the data, but the limitations need to be better described. Public health relevance is addressed. I have attached a word document with more comments.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: Yes.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
      <p>L235-253: Do not just repeat your results and compare them to those of neighbouring countries. Discuss what the implications are;</p>
      <p>L257-259: Is irrelevant;</p>
      <p>L268-271: Not a conclusion from your results;</p>
      <p>L273: You have no results indicating that most goats were not vaccinated and therefore cannot discuss</p>

<bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
</p>
      <p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#x201C;Minor Revision&#x201D; or &#x201C;Accept&#x201D;. </p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: Please see attached document.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: All points covered above.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3: The detailed suggestions are listed for each section:</p>
      <p>Abstract</p>
      <p>L23: &#x2026;..&#x2018;close proximity&#x2019;;</p>
      <p>L28: &#x2026;.were used to detect&#x2026;&#x2026;;</p>
      <p>L31/32: Risk factors were identified using odds ratios;</p>
      <p>L31-33: categorize the variables into dependent and independent variables;</p>
      <p>L34: Say Brucella species rather than Brucella spp.;</p>
      <p>L35: There is possibly an error in the CI for 7.2%;</p>
      <p>L37 and throughout the manuscript: when the p-value is very small, it is expressed as</p>
      <p> p&lt;0.001 or p&lt;0.0001 depending on the significance levels desired;</p>
      <p>L39: Only age, more than&#x2026;. years was a significant risk factor&#x2026;&#x2026;;</p>
      <p>L39-41: For FMD NSP, why isn&#x2019;t commune a significant risk factor when p=2.2x10-16 or rephrase what you have said to make it clear;</p>
      <p>L42/43: Correct to: Q fever seroprevalence for female goats was significantly higher than for males. Why would an imbalance between male and female populations affect the sero-prevalence?-see also L266-267;</p>
      <p>L49: It shouldn&#x2019;t be that animals should be vaccinated on evidence from sero-prevalence. Evidence of actual disease signs or virus detection is better proof of disease presence;</p>
      <p>L&#x2026;- L&#x2026;isn&#x2019;t the author summary the same as the abstract?;</p>
      <p>Introduction</p>
      <p>L78: Replace &#x2018;nowadays&#x2019; with &#x2018;currently&#x2019;;</p>
      <p>L80: &#x2026;as local production is still low (remove still in short supply);</p>
      <p>L86: Moreover, some health pathogens reported&#x2026;&#x2026;..;</p>
      <p>L99-100: Include PPR since you investigated it as well;</p>
      <p>L103: Put a full stop at the end of the sentence;</p>

<bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
</p>
      <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #1: My main comments are that the manuscript sometimes is a bit confusing for the reader, and I have listed some structural comments in the attached document. I also think that the study design description lacks important information and that the discussion needs work, and that aspects such as study limitations should be better included.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #2: Good study worthy of publication.</p>
      <p>Reviewer #3: The authors have indicated that in Cambodia, goat production and goat meat consumption are customary among Muslim communities. Recently, goat meat has gained popularity among Cambodians. Goat farmers use a traditional management system, including grazing, requiring minimal labour. Some government and international organisations have promoted goat production as a secondary source of income for small animal holders to improve their livelihoods. The close proximately between humans and animals could increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. A serological survey was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of some priority zoonoses and high-impact animal diseases in the Cambodian goat population. This is an important study that is relevant to the journal. The results are relevant in highlighting the status of the studied diseases in Cambodian goats. </p>
      <p>The objective of the study is clearly articulated. The study design is appropriate to address the stated objectives. The study population is clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested. The sample size is sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested. The statistical analysis used is inadequate to support conclusions. Ethical and regulatory requirements have been met.</p>
      <p>However, major corrections are required. The manuscript needs to be strengthened through:</p>
      <p>1. Proper use of the English language;</p>
      <p>2. Explanation of why the studied diseases can be classified as neglected diseases and also the justification for focusing on them;</p>
      <p>3. Use of the most appropriate analysis method;</p>
      <p>4. Discussion focused on own findings and implications, including zoonotic ones;</p>
      <p>5. Conclusions drawn from the results of the study;</p>
      <p>6. Framing of the key recommendations emanating from the findings.</p>
      <p>7. Making the figures clear</p>

      <p>***********************</p>
      <p>The authors addressed most of the reviewers' comments. There are only a couple of minor unresolved concerns:</p>
      <p>- The Data Availability Statement is still not in line with the PLOS Data Policy. The data need to be made available prior to publication. Simply listing a point of contact is not sufficient, particularly when no contact information is provided. If the data cannot be posted to a public repository, there needs to be a justification, and based on the type of data in this manuscript it's not clear what the restriction would be. Again, the data is supposed to be made publicly available and not just "upon request."</p>
      <p>- In the Abstract and elsewhere: The authors did not follow the guidance to focus on seroprevalence to pathogens, not the diseases. In other words, "PPRV" should be used when talking about seroprevalence, not "PPR." Same for FMDV instead of FMD. Please correct throughout, unless when referring to the disease.</p>
      <p>Figure Files:</p>
      <p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</ext-link>.

      <p>Dear Dr. Blacksell,</p>
      <p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript 'Risk mapping using serologic surveillance for selected One Health and transboundary diseases in Cambodian goats' has been provisionally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
      <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests.</p>
      <p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: The editorial review process is now complete. PLOS will only permit corrections to spelling, formatting or significant scientific errors from this point onwards. Requests for major changes, or any which affect the scientific understanding of your work, will cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript.</p>
      <p>Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us now if you or your institution is planning to press release the article. All press must be co-ordinated with PLOS.</p>
      <p>Thank you again for supporting Open Access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>

      <p>Dear Dr. Blacksell,</p>
      <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Risk mapping using serologic surveillance for selected One Health and transboundary diseases in Cambodian goats," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
      <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
      <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
      <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
      <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
