All animals were healthy and they received a prophylactic vaccination against brucellosis. The dry split-conjugated vaccine against brucellosis in animals was dissolved in saline and for this purpose, 10 ml of saline was poured into the vaccine vial. Then the content was mixed, and afterward 1 ml was used per animal. Fosprenil was used at the rate of 1 kg of animal weight: 100 kg (calf weight) was multiplied by 0.05 (dose/1 kg of animal weight); 5 ml of fosprenil was obtained, which was collected into disposable syringes and intramuscularly sterilely injected into the croup area.</p><p>Calves in the first group (control) were intramuscularly injected with the vaccine at a dose of 1.0 ml, and fosprenil at a dose of 5.0 ml was administered intramuscularly once to the croup area. Animals from the second group were subcutaneously immunized by the vaccine with polypeptide C at a dose of 1.0 ml. Polypeptide C is a solution that was poured into a vial with a vaccine at a dose of 10.0 ml, the content was mixed, and then calves were injected subcutaneously into the middle third of the neck in 1 ml (10 doses in a vial).</p><p>Immunization of calves in the third group was carried out with a vaccine, diluted with an isotonic sodium chloride solution of 0.9%, at a dose of 1.0 ml subcutaneously once.

The disease is common in Russia, Kazakhstan, Europe, as well as in African countries such as Algeria and others [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This disease causes significant economic damage to livestock farms, especially in cattle and sheep farming. Moreover, brucellosis infection poses a great threat to human health [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although it is not classified as a conventional disease, brucellosis is nevertheless one of the ubiquitously distributed across the globe, representing a high degree of danger to people and animals [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, as an optional intracellular pathogen, establishes a close connection to the host immune cells. This pathogen is capable of supporting a chronic infection, which often complicates any treatment and diagnosis. However, it is worth mentioning that vaccination is the most economical measure to control brucellosis in the endemic areas. In recent decades, many studies have been carried out to develop a safe and effective vaccine against animal brucellosis. Till present, there is no licensed vaccine for the prevention of human brucellosis, which would be useful for protecting people who live in brucellosis endemic areas, especially farmers, veterinarians, animal care workers, laboratory personnel, and the general population [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies aimed at developing an ideal vaccine against animal and human brucellosis have been conducted since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since then, inactivated and attenuated vaccines have been developed [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The Limited Liability Company Agrovet has developed a split-conjugated vaccine against animal brucellosis, containing proteins and soluble high molecular weight peptides of the vaccine strain, which is conjugated with the nano immunoprotector polypeptide-C and adsorbed onto the gel of <italic toggle="yes">aluminum</italic> hydroxide [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In laboratory animals, a polypeptide-C test showed its high ability to activate cellular and humoral mechanisms of immunity. This vaccine has the prospect of being used in veterinary practice and it will help to improve and support the animals&#8217; well-being.</p><p>It was proven that fosprenil activates cellular immunity, in particular, systems of natural resistance (serum bactericidal activity and phagocytosis) and enhances the humoral immune response to a number of bacterial vaccines, thereby increasing the body&#8217;s resistance to infections [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies on the use of immunomodulatory in industrial poultry farming, such as imunofan, gamovit, and fosprenil, have shown their effectiveness in maintaining chicken population, increasing weight gain, as well as their immune activity. As a result of production experience, safety in the experimental groups was 100% against 96% of the control, the average weight in the experimental group reached 2960 g whereas in control 2490 g, while the intensity of immunity in the experimental group reached 80% as opposed to the control group: 65% [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The data presented of pharmacological action of the plant drug fosprenil indicate that fosprenil has a pronounced ability to optimize metabolic processes, provides the intensity of immunity against salmonellosis in piglets under conditions of increased technological load on their body [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>At present, there is poor information about using fosprenil in any composition of anti-brucellosis vaccines. To use this immunomodulatory as a part of the anti-<italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine, with sufficiently high immunogenicity, the study of the fosprenil as a molecular immunomodulatory-adjuvant for split-conjugated brucellosis vaccine seems pertinent.</p><p>The split-conjugated vaccine against animal brucellosis is inactivated, which, according to some authors, nullify harmless, non-toxic both to animals and for the environment [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This allows the vaccine to be used at any time during pregnancy [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is believed that the strains present in attenuated vaccines can be eliminated in the environment, restore their pathogenic properties and thereby maintain the local epizootic distress, not only for animals but can also become a source of infection for humans [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the study was to obtain a vaccine against animal brucellosis having high immunogenic properties by carrying an evaluation of the effectiveness of split-conjugated animal brucellosis vaccine combined with fosprenil and polypeptide C as a molecular immunomodulatory adjuvant according to the results of serological studies of the blood of animals: Agglutination reaction, complement fixation, and Rose Bengal sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All studies involving calves were conducted according to the guidelines laid down by the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrates used for the experimental and other scientific purposes, and in accordance with the local laws and regulations [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Area and schema of the study</title><p>Studies were conducted in the period from June 1, 2018, to September 1, 2018.

The given data indicate that by that time, there were no complementing antibodies in diagnostic titers. In the RBT and AT, all tests gave a positive result; however, the specific antibodies titers were different.</p><p>The highest titers were found in samples of serum calves, which were additionally injected with the polypeptide C (up to 400 IU). In samples, to which fosprenil was added, the antibodies&#8217; titers kept the same level (100 IU). Antibodies titers in samples without immunomodulatory (saline) ranged from 50 to 200 IU.

In tests with fosprenil, two samples were positive (from 1/10 to 1/20), three were negative, and one had an incorrect result.

It was revealed in the same study (Melnik. 2013) that the active ingredient of forprenil is disodium salt of phosphate polyprenols. The introduction of the drug in a dose of 2.5 ml once a day for 5 days activates metabolic processes and, accordingly, increases the average daily weight gain [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the experimental group, where the immunostimulant was injected, no cases of bronchopneumonia were recorded for 2 months of observation. Under the influence of the drug, morpho-biochemical blood parameters increase within the physiological norm, and in calves of the control group, changes characteristic of the onset of the disease with bronchopneumonia were recorded. It follows from the above that fosprenil stimulates natural resistance, increases the body&#8217;s resistance to infections, and reduces the morbidity [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The data obtained by him have been confirmed in our research. Fosprenil also affects the weight gain of the bird, and contributes to the formation of bird immunity, as shown in the experiment on chickens, where the increase in chicken&#8217;s weight using fosprenil is greater than the weight of the control groups in which no fosprenil was administered [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to our experiment, the tested vaccine with immunomodulatory (polypeptide C and fosprenil) also enhances the humoral immune response. Our previous experiment (vaccine tested, and with polyoxidonium immunomodulatory) also showed an increase in humoral immunity in animals [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, fosprenil is used in conjunction with other vaccines. It was shown that fosprenil significantly increased the specific protective activity of the rabies vaccine: When administered together, the immunization index increased 1.9 times as compared to the immunization scheme without fosprenil. In addition, the comparative immunogenicity index of the vaccine was 1.6 times higher with the vaccination using fosprenil. Thus, the indicated finding demonstrates that fosprenil is able to potentiate the specific immunogenicity of tick-borne encephalitis and rabies vaccines [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Experimental data indicate the possibility of using fosprenil for the prevention of avian influenza in combination with vaccination and quarantine measures &#8211; to create a reliable barrier against infection [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The results have shown that split-conjugated vaccine against animal brucellosis is a promising drug for the prevention of this zoonosis.</p><p>The complement-binding antibodies were not detected by serological tests 14 days after immunization; however, in the AT and in the RBT, all samples were positive while highest values in AT (up to 400 IU) were observed in samples of calves&#8217; blood, which were injected polypeptide C.</p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup> day, after immunization in the CFT, not all samples were positive. Using the RBT, samples, to which polypeptide C was injected, had a positive result of 67%. Whereas samples, where fosprenil was injected, a positive result was noted just in two samples as opposed to the control group (saline) where 50% of them gave a positive result.</p><p>The results of serological studies conducted 90 days after vaccination indicate that all animals with a serological reaction negatively responded to brucellosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the small number of animals in the experiment, it was found that the tested, which is considering as an inactivated vaccine, forms a specific humoral immunity in animals. It has tremendous advantages over currently used live vaccines, the causative agent of which is able to survive in the environment, thereby participating in the spread of animal and human brucellosis.</p><p>The developed complex of the split-conjugated vaccine against brucellosis in animals enhances the humoral immune response of the organism against brucellosis and improves the protection of animals against the disease when it is used with the immunomodulatory fosprenil. In the future, we want to expand the use of the resulting complex in the fight against brucellosis on a larger population and to study the change in cellular immunity after the introduction of the resulting complex on an animal organism.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#8217; Contributions</title><p>VAA and FB designed the work.
