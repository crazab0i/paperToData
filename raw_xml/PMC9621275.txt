On 16 December 2020, Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CQCDC) received a report of 15 <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> seropositive employees in a biological products company. The CQCDC and the local health administrative department launched an investigation that included identification of cases, laboratory testing of samples, and employees&#8217; interview to identify the cause of this incident. A case-control study was implemented to compare high-risk factors between cases and serology-negative personals. Human and animal serum samples and environmental swabs were collected for testing. A total of 61 recessive infectors were found with an infection rate of 43.57% (61/140). Fisher&#8217;s exact test showed that there were significant differences in <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection rates among different post classifications (<italic toggle="yes">p&#8201;</italic>=&#8201;0.02), working places (<italic toggle="yes">p&#8201;</italic>=&#8201;0.007), and buildings (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). Case-control study showed that working in vaccine production workshop was independently associated with an increased risk of infection (odds ratio (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic>): 2.60; 95% confidence interval (<italic toggle="yes">CI</italic>): 1.31&#8211;5.19). The positive detection rate was 88.06% (59/67) for production environment and 16.67% (2/12) for external environment. The investigation indicated that close contact with biological products and aerosol were the potential transmission routes of this outbreak under the condition of insufficient personal protection and disinfection. Our study provides new epidemiological evidence for a more detailed understanding of occupational infections with live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic></kwd><kwd>brucellosis</kwd><kwd>outbreak</kwd><kwd>case-control study</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1" id="S001"><title>Highlights</title><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" disp-level="1" id="S002"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic infectious disease caused by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> bacteria, and remains a considerable public health problem in many low-income and developing countries [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The most common clinical symptoms and signs of human brucellosis are prolonged fever, fatigue, sweats, chills, body aches, arthralgia, weight loss, and weakness [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Human brucellosis can be transmitted from infected livestock to humans via inhalation or ingestion of bacteria, conjunctiva, or skin abrasions [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and is also associated with the consumption of unpasteurized milk from infected livestock or close exposure to their secretions [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the transmission of brucellosis from human to human has been reported in the literature [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], this condition is rare.</p><p>Over 500,000 human cases of brucellosis are reported worldwide every year [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and brucellosis is also found to expand in animals and humans in the Pacific region and Asian countries, including China [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#8211;11</xref>]. It is reported that as a class B infectious disease, human brucellosis has been endemic in more than 25 of 32 provinces or autonomous regions in mainland China [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and a total of 448,000 cases were detected in China during 2004&#8211;2016 [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The northern areas of China are found to be traditional endemic regions for brucellosis in both animals and humans by the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while outbreaks of brucellosis have also been observed in neglected southern provinces. In 2018, an outbreak of brucellosis via air-born transmission in a kitchen wastes disposing company in Lianyungang, China, was reported with an attack rate of 33.3% [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Zhan BD et al. reported an occupational outbreak of brucellosis infection in a pharmaceutical factory in Southeast China in 2015 [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that people with occupational exposure were at higher risk for human brucellosis, especially for workers and farmers from butcheries, trading stockyards, and markets in southern China [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, human brucellosis is also considered an occupational disease because it typically occurs in occupational activities where workers are exposed to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>, such as animal husbandry, meat processing, and vaccine production industries [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated an outbreak of occupational <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in a biological products company in Chongqing, in Southwest China. Field epidemiological investigation, laboratory tests, case-control study, and targeted hierarchical strategies of exposure/control were conducted to identify the cause of the outbreak. It can provide scientific basis for supervision and administration of this event and help for preventing occupational outbreaks of human brucellosis in future.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="S003"><title>Material and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S003-S2001"><title>Case report</title><p>On 16 December 2020, Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CQCDC) received a report of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in a biological products company in Chongqing, and 15 persons (15/23) were tested serologically positive for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> during the occupational health check-ups.

A confirmed case was defined as suspected case with positive 1:100 (++) or above serum agglutination test (SAT) for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. A recessive infector was defined as any person whose SAT result was positive without any symptoms. Active case searching was conducted among all workers and managers in the company. We also searched local hospital records and outpatient clinical files, reviewed Infectious Disease Reporting Management Information System in order to find additional cases.

Due to the timely detection and decisive control measures of the epidemic, the outbreak did not spread to surrounding areas. Based on the results of epidemiological investigation, laboratory test, and environmental hygiene investigation, we identified that the most probable workplaces for <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> exposure were the production workshop and sub-packaging workshop. The unsealing of bacteria and the preparation process were conducted by workers with no protective covers in the opening environment, which might lead to the release of live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine into the space. Person who enters the workplace is at risk of direct exposure to live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines. In addition, workers&#8217; poor awareness of protection and inadequate protective measures has increased the risk of touching/inhalation of live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines.</p><p>Occupational infection of brucellosis is common in China, but it is rare for so many <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infected found in an outbreak in a southern Chinese city. In recent years, the burden of brucellosis infection in China has gradually spread from northern pastoral and semi-pastoral areas to southern non-pastoral areas [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One of the important reasons is that with the increased livestock trading between the north and south, and the increased private free-range livestock in the south of China, many brucellosis infections in southern provinces result from imported infected livestock or products from Northern China [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An outbreak of human brucellosis in Jiangsu Province was caused by the plentiful influx of unchecked sheep from Northern China and the lack of an effective prevention programme [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Zhang Z et al. reported the first outbreak of occupational brucellosis involving multiple clusters in Hubei Province, China in 2019, which was due to the influx of infected goats and mutton [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Importing an infected goat was the core link that may lead to the local brucellosis outbreak in Fujian Province, China [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Reports of human brucellosis caused by occupational exposure in farm, slaughter, kitchen wastes disposing company, and even microbiologic laboratory have been documented in previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23&#8211;25</xref>], while the outbreak of brucellosis in the biological products company was rarely reported.</p><p>Some scholars have reported an occupational outbreak of brucellosis infection in a pharmaceutical factory in Southeast China, and exposure was after close contacting with sheep placentas without thorough disinfection [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, Yoshida GJ reported two outbreaks of brucellosis between 2013 and 2015 in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and the confirmed source of infection was sheep placenta [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The common exposures to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> found in the above reports were all due to insufficient personal protection and disinfection after close contact with biological products. Similar problems also existed in this outbreak of Chongqing. However, the difference was that the former was exposed to dead animals, while the latter was exposed to live vaccines. Our investigation found several risk factors of transmission of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in production. Some steps of vaccine production were performed in open conditions without using protective covers, the effectiveness of the ozone disinfection method in the packaging room had not been verified, and individual workers took off goggles or did not wear masks and gloves during the process of sub-packaging. All the above would possibly increase the risk of infecting <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> for workers. It is known that the production of veterinary vaccines has strict operating procedures. Unsealing of bacteria and the filling of bacterial solution are performed manually in an open environment, which poses a potential risk for exposure to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. The lyophilized vaccines are easy to form aerosols and spread rapidly in the closed space if the operation is improper, which could significantly increase the number of infected individuals. Therefore, standardized wearing of PPE and adequate disinfection after potential exposure are particularly important. In addition, many workers without professional training temporarily participated in vaccine production and subcontracting work is also contributed to the large number of persons infected with <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in this outbreak.</p><p>In 2008, an Argentine study of infection by <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> abortus S19 among workers from vaccine-manufacturing plants found that active brucellosis was diagnosed in 21 persons of 30 employees. The positive rate (70.00%) was significantly higher than that of the outbreak in Chongqing (43.57%) [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The live <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines produced by the biological product company in Chongqing are attenuated strain <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> abortus A19 and S2. The A19 strain is derived from the S19 strain, which was a very stable attenuated vaccine developed in the 1920s. It has a good immune effect on cattle and is widely used in many countries. The S2 strain is currently the least virulent strain known in the world and is the most widely used to prevent porcine brucellosis, with high genetic stability. The virulence of these two vaccines is very stable and weak, and they are used for the production of live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines for animals that can be used safely, which may explain why all the positive infected persons did not have any clinical symptoms in this outbreak. The antibodies caused by a small dose of <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine will decay after entering the human body in 3&#8211;6 months. A study performed in Jilin Province, China, has found that asymptomatic infection patients had lower antibody titres, which might result from lower frequency or longer duration of infection [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Contrary to our findings, other studies have demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine infection can cause overt clinical disease in humans [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a detailed study about the characteristics of physiological and attenuated virulence of the A19 strain, the virulence test showed that the A19 was significantly attenuated at the chronic infection stage in infected mouse model, and the A19 was not cytotoxic for macrophages, reduced its ability to invade, survive, and traffic within host cells [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study provides new epidemiological evidence for the virulent characteristics of attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine and will be beneficial for the improvement of current <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccine.</p><p>Chongqing is located in the southwest of China. Although it is not a traditional pastoral area, the infection of brucellosis in humans and animals has been on the rise since the first local case of human brucellosis was reported in 2011. The clinical symptoms of human brucellosis are atypical, and cases are easily misdiagnosed and overlooked by doctors in primary hospitals [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31&#8211;33</xref>]. Therefore, in non-endemic areas, it is paramount to prevent the import of infected animals, enhance recognition and knowledge of brucellosis in doctors, occupational workers, and the general public for effective control of human brucellosis [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34&#8211;36</xref>].</p><p>Although there were no symptoms after infection with live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines of animals, positive cases have been consistently identified over several years, indicating the risk of infection may be existed persistently for years and has not been well controlled. Targeted measures against occupational infection of human brucellosis should be considered throughout the production process. Optimizing production processes, improving general ventilation with air changes, and ensuring the normal use of disinfection equipment can greatly reduce the probability of exposure to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic>. Biological companies should provide effective PPE for workers and urge them to wear it strictly. Health education including occupational health training, PPE management, and good hygiene habits among relevant occupational groups and enterprise managers would be helpful to prevent the occupational outbreak of brucellosis in future. The occupational medical examination, epidemic monitoring of employees, and occupational disease risk assessment should be persistently implemented. In addition, the serologic surveillance of brucellosis in animals and the immunization of herds are also essential preventive measures [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>There were two limitations in our study. Firstly, test of all human samples was SAT positive, but <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> was not tested in the cultured blood samples of cases. The gold standard diagnostic method is <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> culture in spite of time-consuming and low positive rate [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondly, based on the epidemiological evidence and environmental hygiene investigation, close contact and aerosol were potential routes of transmission in these cases, we did not have enough evidence to confirm the exact routes of transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" disp-level="1" id="S006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The outbreak of occupational <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> infection in the biological products company in Chongqing, China, was caused by live attenuated <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> vaccines for animals. We speculate that employees were exposed to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in the production workshop and sub-packaging workshop, and close contact or aerosol were potential routes of transmission in cases. It is of great importance to reinforce the standardized operation of occupational workers in the production process to mitigate occupational exposure to <italic toggle="yes">Brucella</italic> in biological products companies. Sufficient disinfection and individual protection should be strengthened with annual health examinations and sustained symptoms monitoring to prevent similar occupational infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM7824" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="TEMI_A_2130099_SM7824.zip" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the staffs of Rongchang CDC and the members of the expert panel in the environmental hygiene investigation including Chengcai Du, Zheng Zeng, Jiabo Ding, Wenlong Duan, Nan Wang, and Yu Feng.
